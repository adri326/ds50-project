"['what is an abdominal aortic aneurysm?', 'define an abdominal aortic aneurysm.', 'how would you describe an abdominal aortic aneurysm?', 'provide an explanation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.', 'what can you tell me about abdominal aortic aneurysms?', 'explain the concept of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.']","Your aorta carries oxygen-rich blood away from your heart to the rest of your body and your brain. An abdominal aortic aneurysm or AAA is a balloon-like swelling of the aorta which passes through your abdomen (your tummy area).

Your abdominal aorta is usually about 2cm wide or about the width of a garden hose. If you have an aneurysm it can grow from 3cm to over 5.5cm wide. This is classed as an abdominal aortic aneurysm and will need to be checked by a surgical specialist."

However, if an aneurysm becomes large it can cause:

- A pulsating feeling in your stomach
- Pain in your stomach
- Persistent back pain.

A large aneurysm can burst and cause internal bleeding. This is a medical emergency and you should call 999 immediately if you or someone with you has any of these symptoms:

- A sudden severe pain in the abdomen, back or lower back area
- Feeling cold, clammy, sweaty, faint and breathless
- Fainting or passing out."

You’re more at risk if you’re a man over the age of 65 or a woman over the age of 70.

You may also have an increased risk of developing AAA if you have a family history of it. If someone in your family has had an AAA, discuss this with your GP and they may recommend an earlier screening.

There are other risk factors that you can do something about, like:

- Controlling your blood pressure
- Cutting down on alcohol
- Giving up smoking
- Keeping to a healthy weight
- Lowering your cholesterol levels.

Taking these steps can also help reduce the risk of your AAA growing larger if you already have one."

For this reason, all men are invited for a screening test when they turn 65. This test involves a simple ultrasound scan and takes around 10-15 minutes.

You may be advised to get a screening if you’re a women over 70 with a risk factor. If you're female or under 65 and think that you may have AAA or are at risk of developing it, then speak to your GP about the possibility of being referred for an ultrasound scan."

But they can grow, so if you have AAA you will need regular scans to check the size of yours. If your aneurysm grows, the risk of it bursting becomes higher.

If it grows to more than 5.5 cm you will be referred to a surgical specialist to discuss treatment. There are two main treatments available for an abdominal aortic aneurysm:

- Endovascular repair (EVAR) is a type of keyhole surgery. This involves placing a stent-graft (a small metal tube covered with a mesh) inside the artery through a small cut in the groin. If you have this procedure, you’ll usually have a local anaesthetic (where you’re awake but an area on your body is numb). You should be able to get up and walk around the next day. Most people can go home two or three days afterwards. Although this is a simpler and safer procedure than open surgery, it’s not suitable for everyone. Your surgeon will discuss your options with you
- Surgical repair involves replacing the affected part of your aorta with a plastic tube (graft). You will need a general anaesthetic, so you will be asleep for the procedure. Most people who have this operation need to stay in hospital for over a week and it can take some weeks to make a full recovery.

If surgery isn’t appropriate, you’ll have regular scans and advice around lifestyle choices and medications from your doctor."
"['what is an arrhythmia?', 'define the term ""arrhythmia.""', 'how would you describe an arrhythmia?', 'provide an explanation of what an arrhythmia is.', 'what is the meaning of the term ""arrhythmia""?', 'explain the concept of an arrhythmia.']","An arrhythmia is an abnormal heart rhythm. Your heart is controlled by a conduction system which sends out electrical impulses. This causes a heartbeat.

Arrhythmias are caused by a problem in this conduction system, which can make your heart beat too slowly, too quickly, or in an irregular way.

There are different types of arrhythmia, the most common are:

- Atrial fibrillation is the most common irregular, often fast heart rhythm.
- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a very fast heart rhythm. There are different types of SVT. Most are due to electrical impulses not travelling normally from the top chambers of the heart to the bottom chambers of the heart
- Atrial flutter is usually a fast heart rhythm where the top chambers of the heart contract at a very fast rate compared to the lower chambers. This can cause the top chambers to beat extremely fast, sometimes up to 300 beats per minute (bpm)
- Tachybrady syndrome (sick sinus syndrome) causes periods of very fast or slow heart beats
- Heart blocks are caused by a delay or blockage in the conduction system between the top and bottom chambers of the heart which can cause a slow heart rate."

Sinus bradycardias is when your heart beats in a regular way and 60 bpm or below

If you have sinus tachycardia or sinus bradycardia it doesn’t mean there's something wrong with your heart and you might not need treatment. Sometimes it can be due to an underlying condition which you may need treatment for, so your doctor might want to send you for further tests to find out more."

The most common symptoms include:

- Palpitations (a thumping or fluttering sensation in your chest)

- Dizziness
- Feeling as if you may ‘black out’
- Breathlessness
- Chest discomfort
- Feeling tired."

- A heart attack
- Heart failure
- Cardiomyopathy
- Coronary heart disease.

Some abnormal heart rhythms can be caused by inherited conditions, such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, CPVT and PCCD.

If this is the case for you, your doctor will talk to you about having family members tested. Although this can be scary, it can help them know if they need treatment now or in the future.

Other common triggers of an arrhythmia include:

- Viral illnesses
- Recreational drugs
- Alcohol
- Smoking
- Caffeine
- Medications (over-the-counter and prescribed)."

This means that with the right treatment you can carry on living as you were before you were diagnosed.

Living with an abnormal heart rhythm can be emotionally challenging for you and your family. It's important to manage anxiety and stress and get support from your GP or loved ones if needed.

You might have to think about practical matters like driving, going on holiday and returning to work after being diagnosed with an arrhythmia.

If your ability to drive is affected, you must let your insurance company and the DVLA know. Your GP can advise on whether you need to do this.

If your job has an occupational health department, talk to them if you think your job role might have to be altered to better suit you."

The walls of your heart can become weak. And your heart might not be able to pump blood as well as it should.

Your heart has four chambers. The top two are called the atria and the bottom two are called the ventricles. ACM can affect one or both of your ventricle chambers.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is a very rare condition. Most people with ACM can live their normal lives."
"['what is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy?', 'define arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.', 'how would you describe arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy?', 'provide an explanation of what arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is.', 'what can you tell me about arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy?', 'explain the concept of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.']","Sometimes you might see ACM (arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy) being called ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy). The condition used to be called ARVC because it was thought to only affect your heart’s right ventricle chamber.

But research has shown that the condition can affect either the left or right ventricles, or both.

Rarely, ACM can also be called ARVD (arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia)."

These proteins are tiny particles in cells that act like strong glue. When the heart’s cells can’t glue together, the walls of the heart can become weak. Like a brick wall without cement.

ACM is usually a genetic condition. A genetic condition is caused by a change (or mutation) in one or more of your genes. Your genes make up who you are, and you inherit them from your parents.

This means if one of your parents have ACM, you have a 50/50 chance of inheriting the faulty gene that could cause ACM. But even if you inherited the gene, you might not develop the condition. This is known as being a ‘carrier’. You can speak to your specialist about how that might impact you and your family."

But you could have one or more of the following:

- Palpitations (a pounding or fluttering feeling in your chest or neck)
- Feeling lightheaded
- Fainting
- Feeling breathless or shortness of breath
- Abnormal heart rhythms (when your heart beats too fast, too slow or irregularly)
- Swollen ankles, legs or tummy area
- Feeling pain or discomfort in your chest.

Some people living with ACM can feel more symptoms as they get older.

If you feel new symptoms or the symptoms you’re experiencing change, you should talk to your GP or specialist. Your healthcare team might discuss changing your treatment plan with you to manage your symptoms. And they might send you for tests to see how well your heart is working."

You might be sent for these tests if your doctor thinks you could have ACM because of your symptoms, or because someone in your family has the condition. The tests can include:

- Chest x-ray – to see if your heart muscle looks bigger than it should be.
- Cardiac MRI scan – to check your heart’s walls and tissue for signs of damage.
- ECG (electrocardiogram) - to check the rhythm, rate and electrical activity of your heart.
- Exercise test – to check your heart’s rhythm and how your heart works when you’re physically active.
- Echocardiogram – an ultrasound of your chest to see if there’s a problem with the structure of your heart or your heart valves.

These tests are very common but speak to your doctor if you’re worried.

Sometimes it can be tricky to diagnose ACM because the changes it causes to the heart muscle can be very small and hard to see. And the heart’s changes or symptoms can be similar to other conditions. This means doctors often have to rule out other possible conditions first."

They help to reduce and control symptoms, and the risk of complications. This is done by helping your heart pump better and controlling abnormal heart rhythms.

Many people living with ACM are treated with medicines. Sometimes, people with ACM need other treatments like:

- Pacemaker – a small device fitted under your skin, usually near your collarbone, to only help your heart’s rhythm when it doesn’t beat like it should.
- ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) - a small device fitted under your chest’s skin near your collarbone to continuously monitor your heart’s rhythm and treat dangerous, abnormal rhythms.
- Cardioversion – a short, common procedure to set your heart rhythm back to a normal pattern by sending a strong, electrical impulse to your heart muscle.
- Catheter ablation – a common, usually short, procedure to set your heart rhythm back to a normal pattern by blocking your heart’s electrical paths that aren’t working properly.

These treatments are very common for many heart and circulatory conditions. But having treatment can be worrying. If you’re concerned or have questions, your doctor or nurse can support you.

Your healthcare team will regularly look at how well your heart is working and talk to you about your treatment plan."

The main complications can be:

- Heart block - when the electrical messages that tell your heart when to beat are delayed or blocked. This can cause your heart to beat too slow.
- Heart failure – when your heart doesn’t pump blood as well as it should.
- Sudden cardiac death (SCD) - when someone passes away suddenly because the heart has gone into a dangerous rhythm that caused a cardiac arrest. This is rare.

The risk of developing complications can be worrying. It’s important to understand that many people with ACM live their normal lives. Your healthcare team will create a treatment plan with you to manage and monitor your risk. But if you’re concerned, they can also support your emotional wellbeing."

If this happens you might feel an irregular and sometimes fast, heartbeat or pulse. Some people say it feels like their heart is fluttering or racing (known as palpitations).

Atrial fibrillation might come and go (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation), but sometimes it doesn’t go away at all. It’s not life-threatening, but it’s considered serious because it could create blood clots in the heart that may lead to a stroke."

Other symptoms of AF can include:

- Palpitations (feels like a racing, fluttering, flip flopping feeling in your chest)
- Chest pain
- Finding it harder to exercise
- Tiredness
- Shortness of breath
- Dizziness or feeling faint.

Sometimes people don't experience any symptoms and AF gets detected when having an exam or check up. This is common in older people.

Sometimes AF is:

- Occasional, lasting for minutes or hours. You may not need treatment if your heart rate returns to normal.
- Persistent and doesn’t return to normal.
- Long term persistent, which is continuous and lasts over a year.
- Permanent and doesn’t go away. You'll need regular medications or treatment to manage your heart rate and prevent blood clots."
"['what is atrial flutter?', 'define atrial flutter.', 'how would you describe atrial flutter?', 'provide an explanation of what atrial flutter is.', 'what can you tell me about atrial flutter?', 'explain the concept of atrial flutter.']","With atrial flutter the rhythm in your heart is less disorganised than with atrial fibrillation and it may feel milder.

- High blood pressure
- Heart valve disease
- Congenital heart disease
- Pericarditis
- Cardiomyopathy
- Coronary heart disease
- Diabetes
- Having had surgery on your heart
- Physical and mental stress
- Sick sinus syndrome.

AF can also be associated with other health conditions including:

- Asthma

If a clot travels to the brain, it can lead to a stroke. However, with the right treatment, you can work to reduce your risk.

Anticoagulant drugs and a newer class of drugs called NOACs are the most effective treatments to reduce the risk of stroke in people with AF.

As well as taking medication, living a healthy lifestyle really helps to reduce your risk of having a stroke.

We’ve got some ideas, why not try one today?

- Eat healthily: you could start by swapping to lower fat options and going for lean meats instead of fattier options.
- Be physically active: try a brisk half hour walk every day and take the stairs when you can.
- Quit smoking: did you know 20 minutes after you quit smoking, your heart rate and blood pressure return to normal?
- Cut down on alcohol: try halving your units or mixing juice with sparkling water as an alternative
- Control high blood pressure: by cutting down on salt and managing stress.
- Work on your cholesterol levels: by eating more fibre and swapping saturated fats (butter, takeaway meals) for unsaturated fats (olive oil, oily fish).
- Be mindful of your blood sugar levels (especially if you have diabetes). Swap sugary snacks for fruits and choose sugar free drinks."

ECGs are very common tests. They record the electrical activity in your heart through sensors that are stuck on your chest, arms and legs. The test can help your doctor find problems with the rhythm of your heart. ECGs are usually quick and painless.

If your ECG appears normal, you might need other tests if you’ve got symptoms. Other tests might include:

- You may need another type of ECG where you will receive an injection of medication that will try to make your heart go into an abnormal rhythm in a controlled way. Your healthcare team will be monitoring you through it to keep you safe.
- Wearing a portable ECG for 24 or 48 hours (a Holter test). This will help your doctor monitor your heart rhythm for longer. You’ll have sensors stuck to your chest and they will be connected to a small recording device on a belt you’ll wear around your waist.
- A blood or saliva test to see if you have the faulty (or changed) gene that could cause a heart condition, like Brugada syndrome.

Many people have these tests every day but if you’re worried about them, you can talk to your doctor or specialist before your test. They will help you understand what to expect and answer any questions you have.

After your diagnosis, you may be referred for genetic testing to screen for any faulty genes that are linked with the condition. Your immediate family members (such as parents, siblings and your children) may also be invited for assessment."

Most people can manage their risk of developing a very fast heart rhythm with some simple lifestyle choices.

You might be advised to avoid things that could trigger a very fast heartbeat, like:

- A high temperature – if you become unwell with a fever, you can help to lower it by taking paracetamol unless you've been told not to take it by your doctor.
- Dehydration – if you have diarrhoea or have been sick for more than a day, you might become dehydrated and you should contact your doctor for advice. You might lose a lot of fluid and may need special rehydration drinks.
- Drinking too much alcohol – too much alcohol can increase the risk of experiencing an irregular heart rhythm. Try to stick to the recommended weekly amount of alcohol.
- Taking certain medicines – some medicines can trigger Brugada syndrome. Always let any medical professional you see know about your condition, so they can check prescribed medications are right for you.
- High intensity exercise or sports – physical activity is good for your mental and physical health, but your doctor might advise you to find alternatives to some high intensity exercises. Some options are yoga or pilates. If you like getting out, riding a bike may be more suitable than running.

If your healthcare team think you have a higher risk of developing a potentially dangerous heart rhythm, they might suggest you have an ICD fitted to manage your condition and reduce your risk:

- ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) - this is a small device fitted under your skin, usually near your collarbone. It will send a shock to reset your heartbeat if it becomes dangerously fast.

Your doctor or specialist will regularly assess how your heart is working and your treatment plan. Their advice or recommended treatment might change over time so it’s important to go to any appointments. They will support you and answer any questions you might have."

You should speak to your healthcare team about what activities are safe for you to do. They will discuss your condition and the long-term impact on your lifestyle it might have. And they will support you if you feel worried or have questions.

You should be aware that:

- If you need an ICD, there may be things to plan for, such as not driving for a little while after having it fitted.
- In some cases, medication, such as beta blockers, may help prevent or reduce the occurrence of abnormal heart rhythms.
- You should discuss over-the-counter medicines and supplements with your doctor as some of these may cause symptoms or react with medicines you may already be taking.
- Prolonged (longer than a day) or severe episodes of vomiting or diarrhoea can affect your sodium and potassium levels. You should discuss this with your doctor who may prescribe oral rehydration supplements. These supplements can help to replenish sodium and potassium levels but should be used under medical supervision.
- You should always inform medical staff that you have Brugada Syndrome when you speak to them."

Not all abnormal heart rhythms are life-threatening, but some mean that the heart cannot pump blood around the body.

Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is an example of a dangerous heart rhythm that can lead to a cardiac arrest. This is when the heart quivers or ‘fibrillates’ instead of pumps. Common arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation aren’t life-threatening although they cause irregular, fast heart rhythms.

Some conditions can cause abnormal heart rhythms and in turn, a cardiac arrest if they're severe or left untreated:

- Cardiomyopathies (disease of the heart muscle) and inherited heart conditions which affect the electrical system of the heart, such as Brugada syndrome
- Congenital heart disease – a heart condition or defect you get before you’re born
- Heart valve disease – when one or more of your heart valves don’t work properly
- Severe or untreated myocarditis \- inflammation of the heart muscle.

Other causes of cardiac arrest include:

- A heart attack (often caused by coronary heart disease)
- A severe haemorrhage (losing a large amount of blood)
- Hypoxia - a severe drop in oxygen levels
- Electrocution
- A drug overdose"

After a cardiac arrest, you’ll be looked after in a coronary care or intensive care unit. This is where people who need special monitoring go so a close eye can be kept on them. You may be put in an induced coma and kept asleep to allow your body to recover.

Mid-term recoveryL

Doctors will want to work out what caused the cardiac arrest. They can then recommend medication and treatment, such as a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), to reduce the risk of it happening again.

They may also refer you to cardiac rehabilitation to help rebuild your confidence, fitness and strength levels. Each programme is different, but it usually involves regular assessments such as checking your pulse and blood pressure, psychological support, health education talks and exercise sessions.

Long-term recovery:

The time it takes to recover depends on what caused your cardiac arrest and how long it took for your heart to beat on its own again after the arrest. It could take several weeks, a few months or longer if you need more rehab for things like learning to walk and caring for yourself again.

However long it takes, your doctor will support you during this time. Talk to family and doctors about what will happen once you go home and practical matters, like driving and returning to work."

Within your heart cells, proteins regulate the release of calcium ions. If these proteins function abnormally, it can lead to a rise in the level of calcium inside your cells.
The extra calcium can cause arrhythmias - also known as abnormal heart rhythms. In particular CPVT causes a very fast heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia."

- blackouts
- palpitations
- dizziness
- fainting.
These can be brought on by too much physical activity and stressful times, which can cause an increase in the amount of adrenaline running through your blood.
Some people have no symptoms of CPVT.
If you're with someone when they collapse suddenly and aren't breathing normally, call 999 immediately and try to perform cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until an ambulance or medical help arrives. If you are untrained in CPR, the 999 operator will be able to talk you through the process.

This is an ECG that records your heart's electrical activity whilst you exercise, to try and induce the abnormal rhythm in a controlled, safe way.
Someone may also have an resting ECG and 24 hour monitor.
You'll need to discuss the level of activity that is safe for you with your doctor. It’s very important that families affected by CPVT receive an accurate assessment, diagnosis, treatment and support from specialists in a clinic for inherited heart conditions.
Genetic testing can also be done if someone in your family has already been diagnosed with CPVT even if you don’t have symptoms of the condition."

avoid intense exercise and competitive sports
take a daily medicine like beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers
have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implanted to monitor your heart rate and stop dangerous heart rhythms. 
Beta-blockers help to slow down your heart rate and help to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias. 
If someone is having ventricular tachycardia (the very fast heart rate), they are usually given an electrical cardioversion/defibrillation (shock) to return the heart rhythm back to normal. Having a VT is an medical emergency so needs treatment right away. 
Roughly 1 in 3 people need to be fitted with an ICD if medication is not enough to reduce the risk of an dangerous abnormal heart rhythm.  If this is the case you will have to avoid contact sports and it could affect the type of work you do, especially if you work with magnetic or power tools."

For example, bacteria can often enter the bloodstream through the mouth or skin because of an existing infection in those areas.
Since there are many ways you may develop endocarditis, your doctor might not be able to find the exact cause. However, those most at risk of endocarditis usually have damaged heart valves, artificial heart valves or other heart defects.
Your risk of endocarditis is higher if you:
- have heart valve disease

The most common symptoms of endocarditis are:
- flu-like symptoms – these include having a temperature, tiredness, headaches, chills, a cough and sore throat
- poor appetite or unexplained weight loss
- pale skin
- aching muscles and joints
- heart murmurs (an abnormal heart sound). 
Other rarer symptoms you may see or feel include:
- small dark-coloured spots on the skin
- unusual dark lines under your fingernails

The following procedures can help to diagnose endocarditis:
- blood tests to find out what type of bacteria is causing the inflammation
- an echocardiogram (echo) to look for signs of damage in your heart
- an electrocardiogram (ECG) to look for an abnormal heart rhythm
- a chest X-ray to check for fluid build-up in your lungs
- an MRI scan to get clearer views of your heart.

You’ll be given antibiotics into your vein through a drip. If your symptoms and temperature improve, your doctor might decide to let you go home.
To treat the endocarditis after this stage, you will need to:
- continue taking antibiotics – normally for up to six weeks
- have regular appointments with your GP to monitor your progress
- have blood tests to make sure your body is fighting the infection.

It's caused by a genetic mutation (a change in one or more genes) making your liver less able to remove excess ‘bad’ cholesterol, known as LDL. This means the LDL level in your blood can get too high. Having FH means you’re at risk of getting heart and circulatory disease at an early age if it’s not treated.
FH is one of the most common inherited conditions that affects about 1 in every 250. It’s estimated that around 270,000 people in the UK have it, but many don’t know they do.
If one of your parents has the condition, there’s a 50 per cent (1 in 2) chance that you could have it. If you have FH, there’s a 1 in 2 chance that you could pass it on to any of your children."

Other risk factors – like high blood pressure or smoking – can also cause atheroma build-up.
A build-up of atheroma means your arteries gradually become narrower, making it harder for blood to flow to your vital organs. This puts you at higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke."

you have a heart attack or stroke, especially if it happens at a young age
other members of your family have a history of premature heart disease or stroke
other members of your family have been diagnosed with FH.
You may also notice physical changes to your body that suggest you have FH. Your doctor will perform a simple physical exam to check for these symptoms. These can include:
- Tendon xanthomata: This is swelling on your knuckles, knees or your Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. It's caused by a build-up of excess cholesterol.	 
- Xanthelasmas: These are small lumps of cholesterol that build up in the skin around the bottom of your eye and on your eyelid. They are usually pale yellow in colour. 	 
- Corneal arcus: This is a pale white ring around your iris, the coloured part of your eye. If you’re under 50 years old and have corneal arcus, it's possible that you have FH."

If your results come back high, or if your doctor notices some of the physical signs of FH listed above, they will refer you to a specialist for an assessment, which is likely to include genetic testing. The specialist will explain which of your relatives should be checked out, too.
Genetic testing is a DNA test that’s done to see if you have a faulty gene which can cause an inherited condition. This test may be:
- a blood sample
- a mouth swab, from the inside of your cheek.
If you’re diagnosed with FH, your first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) should also be tested as soon as possible. FH is an inherited condition which means that if a parent has FH, their child has a 50% chance of inheriting it.
If one of your family members has FH, you should get tested as well. Early diagnosis of FH means you can get treatment and improve your lifestyle to lower your cholesterol and avoid risk to your health."

Treatment can greatly reduce your risk of getting coronary heart disease, having a heart attack or stroke, or needing other treatments. If you or your child is diagnosed with FH, your doctor will discuss and agree a treatment plan with you.
FH is usually treated using medicines called statins, which help to lower your cholesterol levels.
There are other types of medicines which can be used to lower blood cholesterol levels either instead of or as well as statins. These are:
- ezetimibe
- PCSK9 inhibitors such as alirocumab and evolocumab
- bempedoic acid
- inclisiran
- fibrates such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate.
As well as taking medications, you'll need to make changes to your diet and lifestyle which also help to improve your cholesterol level.
People with high cholesterol often find they can bring their levels of cholesterol down just by changing their diet. Unfortunately, FH can’t be treated through diet alone, but you should still make sure you:
- maintain a healthy weight
- do plenty of exercise
- don’t smoke
- drink less alcohol."

- chest pain or discomfort in your chest that suddenly occurs and doesn't go away. It may feel like pressure, tightness or squeezing
- the pain may spread to your left or right arm or may spread to your neck, jaw, back or stomach 
- you may also feel sick, sweaty, light-headed or short of breath.
Other less common symptoms include:
- a sudden feeling of anxiety that can feel similar to a panic attack
- excessive coughing or wheezing
If you think you're having a heart attack, call 999 for an ambulance immediately. 
Women may be less likely to seek medical attention and treatment quickly, despite the warning signs. This can dramatically reduce your chance of survival. 
Rapid treatment is essential, and the aim is to restore blood flow to the affected part of the heart muscle as soon as possible. This helps to limit the amount of damage to the heart."

Post menopause, your risk rises and continues to rise as you get older. 
As you get older it is increasingly important to be aware of the risk factors that can affect your risk of developing CHD. The more risk factors you have, the higher your risk. Risk factors include:
- high blood pressure
- high cholesterol
- diabetes
- smoking
- being overweight
- not doing enough physical activity.
Identifying and managing risk factors early on could help lower your risk of a heart attack in the future.  
We recommend that all women over the age of 40 visit their local GP or nurse for a health check to check their cardiovascular risk. If you're aged 40–74 and living in England, you can ask for an NHS health check. Similar schemes are also available in other parts of the UK.
Your doctor should invite you to review your risk every five years, but you can also just make an appointment yourself to check your blood pressure and cholesterol. This check might help to highlight anything that could put you at increased risk of having a heart attack.
If you have a family history of heart or circulatory disease make sure you tell your doctor or nurse. You're considered to have a family history of heart or circulatory disease if:
- your father or brother was under the age of 55 when they were diagnosed with a heart or circulatory disease or
- your mother or sister was under the age of 65 when they were diagnosed with a heart or circulatory disease."

This affects how your body works, including your breathing and muscles. This causes some of the main symptoms of heart failure, like:
- fainting or feeling lightheaded
- feeling increasingly tired or weak at rest which gets worse with movement
- new persistent cough
- shortness of breath when you’re active or resting

It can happen suddenly or it can progress slowly over months or years. The most common causes of heart failure are:
- a heart attack - this can cause long-term damage to your heart, affecting how your heart can pump blood
- cardiomyopathy - a disease of the heart muscle which can be inherited or caused by infections or pregnancy
- high blood pressure – this puts strain on the heart, which can lead to heart failure over time.
Other causes of heart failure include:
- abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) – where your heart beats too fast, too slow or irregularly
- amyloidosis - a build-up of abnormal proteins (building blocks that make up things like muscle and hair) in organs such as your heart and tissues. When it affects the heart it's called cardiac amyloidosis - ‘stiff heart syndrome’ - and can lead to heart failure
- anaemia – a lack of red blood cells carrying oxygen in your blood
- congenital heart conditions – different heart problems that you’re born with
- endocarditis - a viral infection affecting the heart muscle
- heart valve disease - where blood struggles to flow through the heart properly, putting extra strain on the muscle
- pulmonary hypertension - raised blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply your lungs. This condition can damage the right side of your heart, leading to heart failure. Find out more about pulmonary hypertension on NHS Choices and PHA UK
- some cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy
- thyroid gland disease – an underactive or overactive thyroid gland which produces too few or too many hormones
- too much alcohol (more than the recommended limit of 14 units a week)."

You may then be sent for tests such as:
- a 24-hour ECG - in some cases, you may need this test which records the rhythm, rate and electrical activity of your heart over a longer period
- a chest x-ray – to check if there's fluid in your lungs or if a lung condition is causing the symptoms
- an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of your heart to see how it’s working
- blood tests – to check your overall health and for signs of a problem with your heart (this may include testing your BNP levels, which rise when heart failure is worse and decrease when it’s better)

This is to do with the amount of blood squeezed out of the main chamber of the heart with every beat. It’s usually measured as a percentage – over 50% is considered normal. Your ejection fraction is measured from an echocardiogram.
Heart Failure can be put into different groups depending on your ejection fraction. Depending on the percentage measured, and other tests, your heart failure may be classed as the following:
- heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) - >50%)
- heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (>40% - 49%)

- Innocent heart murmur – when your heart still beats normally but makes extra sounds when your blood flows through your heart faster than usual. Innocent murmurs are harmless. 
Innocent heart murmurs are common in babies, young people and adults. They can come and go or happen regularly throughout your life. 
- Abnormal heart murmur – when the extra sounds in your heartbeat are caused by a problem with your heart. This can be dangerous if it’s left untreated, but this is rare. 
Abnormal heart murmurs are rare, especially in babies or young people. If your doctor thinks you might have an abnormal heart murmur, they will arrange tests to see how your heart is working.

They stop the blood flowing backwards.
There are four valves in your heart, they are:
- the tricuspid valve and the pulmonary valve on the right side of the heart
- the mitral valve and the aortic valve on the left side of your heart."

There are several types of heart valve disease. The main problems are caused by the valve not opening fully or the valve not closing properly:
If the valve doesn’t open fully, it will block or restrict the flow of blood. This is called valve stenosis or valve narrowing.
If the valve doesn’t close fully, the blood will leak back into the heart instead of forwards into the body. This is called valve incompetence, valve regurgitation or a leaky valve.
These problems can put extra strain on your heart and make your heart work harder. This can cause you to have symptoms like feeling more tired and out of breath. And over time, it can increase your risk of having a heart attack, a stroke and other heart conditions."

- Torsades de pointes (a dangerously fast heart rate)
- ventricular fibrillation (when the bottom chambers of your heart quiver instead of beat).
Your abnormal heart rhythm may return to normal but if it doesn’t you’re at risk of sudden cardiac arrest (when your heart stops pumping).
The causes and symptoms of LQTS depend on each person. That’s why your doctor will assess you as an individual. They may advise you to avoid competitive sport, which can be difficult if you’re a very active person or used to exercising at a high level. Ask your doctor anything you might be concerned about."

They include:
- discussion – because LQTS can be inherited, your doctor will ask questions about your family history. They may also ask you about any medications you have been taking
- ECG - to monitor the electrical activity of your heart. This is the main way that LQTS is checked. You may be given a 24-hour ECG monitor to look at your heart for a longer period of time
- exercise ECG – sometimes LQTS doesn’t show up on a standard ECG, so the test needs to be done more than once and in different ways like when you’re exercising.
As LQTS is sometimes inherited, you may also be referred for genetic testing to screen for any faulty genes that are linked with the condition. Your immediate family members (such as your parents, siblings and your children) may also be invited for an assessment."

Beta blockers, such as propranolol or nadolol, help control irregular heartbeats and slow your heart rate to make the prolonged QT interval less likely.
If you’re at risk of a life-threatening arrhythmia and you need more than just medication to manage this risk, you may need a pacemaker or ICD fitted. These are fitted to help control the rhythm and rate of your heart or help correct life-threatening heart rhythms.
Some people may need surgery to remove certain nerves that affect the heart to help reduce the chance of a sudden cardiac arrest. This is usually only for people who cannot take medication.
Others with LQTS may need to be prescribed potassium supplements from their doctor. They might also suggest you increase your uptake of potassium-rich foods like bananas, vegetables and pulses. If you’re taking any new medication or supplements, always check with your pharmacist that what you’re taking is okay with LQTS.
It's important to stay hydrated after illness. Always tell medical staff you have LQTS."

However, you should be aware that:
- if you need an ICD or pacemaker, there may be things to plan for, such as not driving for a little while after having it fitted
- you may have to give up some competitive sports, but your doctor can advise you on physical activity which comes with less risk
- you may have to take potassium supplements prescribed by your doctor or increase the amount of potassium-rich food in your diet
- some over-the-counter medicines or supplements can increase your symptoms so you should discuss these with your doctor and pharmacist before taking them
- prolonged (longer than a day) or severe episodes of vomiting or diarrhoea can affect your sodium and potassium levels. You should discuss this with your doctor who may wish to prescribe oral rehydration supplements. These supplements can help to replenish sodium and potassium levels but should be used under medical supervision."

2. Call 999. If the person is unconscious and not breathing, or not breathing normally, start CPR.
3. If there is someone with you, ask them to find a defibrillator. 
4. Start chest compressions. With the heel of your hand in the centre of their chest, press down smoothly and firmly at a rate of 2 per second. Try pushing to the beat of Stayin’ Alive by the Bee Gees. 
5. Use a defibrillator as soon as you can. Follow its instructions carefully while you continue to give CPR."

It’s when someone gives chest compressions to a person in cardiac arrest to keep them alive.  

When a person is in cardiac arrest their heart stops pumping blood, which means their brain gets no oxygen.

It can offer some protection against coronary artery disease therefore reducing the risk of a heart attack. It helps to control your cholesterol levels and so reduces the risk of fatty plaques building up inside the artery walls. 

As we get older the blood vessels can become stiffer, caused by high blood pressure. This is a risk factor associated with heart attacks and stroke

During and after the menopause, a woman’s body gradually produces less oestrogen than it used to. This increases the risk of the coronary arteries narrowing whereas it previously protected the lining of the artery walls reducing the build-up of plaque.

If you experience these, you may be prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to help relieve the symptoms.

HRT can be very effective for relieving some symptoms of the menopause. But some women avoid taking it because they worry that it may increase their risk of certain health conditions such as blood clots.

Taking HRT in tablet form can increase the risk of a blood clot, which such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower leg or pulmonary embolus in the lung. But this risk can be reduced by having HRT through the skin, as a patch or gel. You should discuss your individual needs with your GP.

Inflammation is your body’s natural way of fighting things that can harm it, such as infections or injuries. It can cause symptoms that affect your daily life.

Myocarditis can develop suddenly (acutely), can be recurring or it can be long-lasting (chronic). Most people will recover without any lasting effects. But in rare cases, if the inflammation is severe, myocarditis can scar the heart muscle. This damage means the heart has to work harder to pump blood and oxygen around the body. In some cases, this can result in the heart muscle becoming bigger, and over time, weaker.

Sometimes, myocarditis can affect the heart’s electrical system, leading to an irregular heart beat (arrythmia)."

- Chest pain or discomfort, or a feeling of tightness in the chest
- Shortness of breath, either at rest or when active, or in certain positions, such as lying down
- Unusual tiredness
- Palpitations (like your heart is fluttering, racing, or pounding) 
- An irregular heartbeat
- Feeling light-headed or fainting
- Recent flu-like symptoms such as high temperature, headaches, body aches, joint pain, or sore throat 
- Rarely, swelling in hands, legs, ankles or feet. 

Some people have no symptoms, and their myocarditis may be picked up as part of a routine health appointment.

When myocarditis is caused by a virus, symptoms can start to show one or two weeks later. This is because the immune system, the body’s own natural defence system, overreacts to being infected with a virus, and causes inflammation. This inflammation can stay in the heart even after the virus has gone.

Other causes include:

- bacterial infections, such as sore throat, or chest infection, or fungal infections, such as athlete’s foot
- auto immune diseases (when your own immune system attacks your body), for example lupus
- a reaction to harmful substances (toxins), such as carbon monoxide, or drugs such as cocaine
- a reaction to certain medicines or vaccines
- There have been rare cases of myocarditis following the Moderna covid vaccine (or even more rarely, the Pfizer vaccine). If you are worried, you can find out more about what covid vaccines mean for your heart.

You may have tests, including: 

- an ECG (electrocardiogram) 
- an echo (echocardiogram) 
- a chest X-ray 
- blood tests.

These tests will help your doctor with your diagnosis.  These tests are very common, don’t take long (sometimes just a few minutes), and most people don’t feel any pain or discomfort when having them.  Other tests such as cardiac MRI and coronary angiogram may be done to help rule out other common cardiac causes.

- antibiotics, if a bacterial infection is the cause
- rest 
- general remedies if you feel unwell, such as plenty of fluids, rest and painkillers.

Your doctor will want to watch your progress and may ask you to come back for check-ups occasionally, although these may only be once a year.  It’s important to go to your appointments even if you feel well.  Going to these appointments will help give you the support you need.

A cardiac arrest is when your heart suddenly stops pumping blood around your body. This stops your breathing and starves your brain of oxygen.

The rhythm of your heart (which controls your heartbeat) is controlled by electrical impulses. If the electrical impulses go wrong, it can cause an abnormal heart rhythm known as an arrhythmia. Some arrhythmias can be dangerous if they’re left untreated, they can cause a cardiac arrest. Your heart’s rhythm and electrical impulses are no longer there after death, this means an abnormal heart rhythm can’t be found and the heart’s structure will appear normal. This is why the cause of the cardiac arrest can’t be found and SADS might be diagnosed.

**Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome affects around 500 people in the UK every year.**

You may also see sudden arrhythmic death syndrome, or SADS, being called sudden adult death syndrome.

An arrhythmia usually causes the heart to beat too fast, too slow or irregularly. It is usually caused by a heart condition that affects the heart’s electrical system.

Sometimes, the heart condition that causes the arrhythmia can be inherited. Inherited heart conditions are often the cause of SADS if they are left undetected and untreated. These conditions include:

- Long QT syndrome (LQTS)
- Brugada syndrome
- Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)
- Progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD).

A condition that causes SADS is undetectable after death because the heart will appear normal. But there are a few conditions that can cause SADS because of very subtle changes to the heart. SADS may still be diagnosed because the structural changes are too small to be seen when the heart is examined after death.

These conditions include:

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
- Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)

Thanks to research, we now know that these conditions are caused by changes (or mutations) in one or more of our genes. We can sometimes discover these changes with genetic testing for family members, known as cascade testing. In some cases, this is the only way of telling if someone has an inherited heart condition or if they are at risk of developing one."

A post-mortem usually happens within two to three working days after the death.

If you have recently lost a loved one suddenly, or know someone who has, you may want to contact a bereavement officer at your local hospital. They can offer emotional and practical support during what might be an extremely difficult time for you, and they can be your main point of contact after the death and the post-mortem examination.

During the post-mortem examination, a pathologist (a doctor trained in the study of disease) will look for conditions that could have caused the death, such as:

- coronary heart disease
- heart attack
- heart failure
- clots on the lungs

If the pathologist can’t find an obvious cause of death, they may do further tests such as:

- look at organ tissue
- test for medications or drugs in the body
- ask for an assessment by an expert heart pathologist.

The coroner will then decide on a cause of death. SADS is declared if the death is still unexplained after these tests.

When this happens, the coroner will usually recommend that family members are tested for inherited heart conditions. Some people might not feel ready to be tested after losing a loved one which is understandable, but the tests are usually simple for most people. The earlier you and your family are tested, the less you risk a family member possibly leaving a heart problem untreated.

If someone in your family has been diagnosed with a heart condition or has passed away from SADS, you might be referred to a Genetics Clinic to assess your risk of developing the condition too."

A genetic test is usually done with a simple blood test. It can also be carried out on a sample of hair, skin or bodily tissue.

Genetic tests can find genetic faults. A fault could mean you are at risk of developing the same inherited heart condition that your family member has.

If someone has a heart condition or has died from SADS, the immediate family (their parents, siblings and children) might be referred for genetic tests. The tests are normally done in an inherited heart condition clinic at a hospital or genetics centre.

During your appointment, you might also be asked about your health, family history and if you have any symptoms. It’s helpful to bring information about any family members who have passed away unexpectedly or have been diagnosed with heart and circulatory diseases."

In some cases this can lead to a heart attack or cardiac arrest.

Your coronary arteries are made up of three layers. SCAD happens when one or more of the inner layers of a coronary artery tears away from the outer layer.

Blood is able to flow into the space between the layers and a blood clot forms, reducing the flow of blood through the artery.

This can lead to a heart attack, as the blood supply to your heart has been blocked. Or a cardiac arrest.

SCAD is a rare heart condition that happens suddenly with no apparent warning. It is most common in women who are in their 40’s and 50’s, but can happen to anyone. The condition can’t currently be predicted or prevented.

Most people who have SCAD do not have usual risk factors for heart disease such as high cholesterol, smoking or diabetes. These are often the risk factors which can increase your chance of having a heart attack. This means that SCAD is can be misdiagnosed or there may be a delay in diagnosis.

People with no risk factors often ignore symptoms, as they don’t think they’d be at risk of a heart attack. But it’s important to get checked out if you get any SCAD symptoms, so it can be diagnosed as early as possible."

You can also discuss any concerns or questions you might have.

Some people’s hearts will permanently change shape and they may continue to experience symptoms such as tiredness, chest pain and lack of energy.

About 1 in 10 people who’ve had takotsubo cardiomyopathy develop it again after they’ve recovered.

As takotsubo is usually caused by a distressing trigger, you might find it helpful to talk to a counsellor or clinical psychologist during and after your recovery. If you're registered with a GP, you can access psychological therapy through the NHS or find your nearest counsellor."

It makes your heart have episodes where it beats abnormally fast.

Wolff-Parkinson-White happens when there is an extra electrical connection in the heart. This problem with the heart is present at birth (congenital), although symptoms may not develop until later in life. Many healthy young adults get diagnosed with it.

Some people with this extra electrical connection don't have an irregular heart beat (tachycardia). This means they have a Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern and not WPW syndrome.

Sometimes WPW syndrome settles down on its own."

The walls then relax, allowing the heart to fill with blood again. This is controlled by electrical signals.

In WPW syndrome there is an extra signalling pathway between the heart's upper and lower chambers. This pathway creates a ‘short circuit’ that shouldn’t be there. Electrical signals travel round the ‘short circuit’ in a loop, causing episodes of tachycardia (where the heart beats very fast)."

If you’re experiencing symptoms and your doctor thinks you might have WPW syndrome, you may have any of these tests:

- An ECG
- An ambulatory ECG - a small, portable ECG recorder to continue monitoring your heart for 24 hours or a few days. You’ll have some small sticky pads put on your chest. They’ll be attached to a small recording device which you’ll wear on a belt around your waist
- Adenosine -  a small amount is injected through a vein. It allows the doctors to see any ‘extra’ pathways linked to WPW

*You have the WPW pattern but have never had any episodes of tachycardia:*

You have the extra signalling pathway (WPW pattern) but have never had any episodes of fast heart rate (tachycardia). This means that you probably won't need treatment, and in some young people, the condition disappears or improves as you get older. People in high risk jobs (like a pilot or professional athlete) are usually offered tests to check their risk of having a sudden cardiac arrest.

*You’ve got the extra signalling pathway (WPW pattern) and you have symptoms caused by a fast heart rate (tachycardia):*

The priority is to stop the tachycardia and return the heart rate and rhythm back to normal. There are a few ways that this can be treated:

**Vagal manoeuvres** – these are different techniques to help get your heart rate back to normal. They stimulate nerves that slow down your heart’s electrical messages. Your doctor will teach you the techniques and let you what ones will be best for you.

**Medication** – if vagal manoeuvres don’t work, you might be given an injection of some medicine to block the extra electrical signals in your heart. This will make your heart’s electrical messages travel through the normal path and set your heartbeat back to normal.

**Cardioversion** - this sets your heart rhythm back to a normal pattern by sending controlled electrical signals to your heart. Your specialist will then offer treatment to avoid this from happening again."

Techniques and treatments that can help prevent episodes include:

**Medication** – to control the speed of the electrical messages being sent to your heart or to take during an episode.

**Lifestyle choices** – you may be told to avoid things that could trigger an episode. This can include having less alcohol and caffeine and avoiding intense exercise, like running or competitive sports. Your doctor can answer any questions you might have.

**Catheter ablation** – this procedure is commonly used to destroy the extra part of the heart causing the problems in the heart's electrical system. It works with most people and is very effective.

For many people with WPW syndrome, their episodes of a fast heartbeat are short, harmless and settle down on their own. You might not need any treatment if your symptoms are mild or rare.

The most common places to take blood are from a vein inside your elbow or a vein on the back of your hand as your veins are closer to the surface there.

A tight band (tourniquet) is placed around your arm just above the area where the blood is to be taken. This causes the vein to come nearer to the surface of your skin, making it easier for your blood sample to be taken. The area will be cleaned with an antiseptic wipe or swab before the test is taken.

The needle is usually attached to either a syringe or a plastic device called a vacutainer and the blood put into a blood collecting container called a vial, so once the blood sample has been taken it can easily be sent to a laboratory for analysis. The vials often contain small amounts of chemical stopping the blood from clotting in transit.

It may be possible for you to apply a cream that numbs the area before you have the test, but this will take a little while to be effective, so it might be an idea to apply it before you go to have the test done.

Rarely, some people feel faint during a blood test. This is more likely to happen if you are dehydrated, so try to drink some water before having your blood test.

- **Thyroid function tests** – these show if you have an underactive or overactive thyroid gland, which produces a hormone called thyroxine. If the levels are abnormal they can be linked to some heart conditions and symptoms linked to having a slow or fast heart rate or palpitations.
- **Lipid profile** - measures your cholesterol level and breakdown of good and bad fats found in your blood.
- **Liver tests** - the liver is a vital organ with many functions. This test gives a breakdown of how well the liver is functioning, which if not working well can have a major impact on the rest of the body.
- **Clotting screen** - this measures how quickly your blood clots. This is important if you take blood thinning medication such as warfarin.
- **BNP (B-type natriuretic peptides) tests** – these show the level of a hormone in your blood which if elevated can be a sign of heart failure.
- **U and Es test** – this stands for urea (a protein found in the blood) and electrolytes which measures the levels of sodium, potassium and other important chemicals in your blood such as magnesium and calcium.

This is an ECG that is recorded while you are walking on a treadmill or cycling on an exercise bike. The aim of this test is to see how your heart works when you are more active.

**24-hour ECG recording**

Also called Holter monitoring or ambulatory ECG monitoring, this involves continuously recording your heart’s electrical activity for 24 to 48 hours, sometimes longer. This can help diagnose conditions such as atrial fibrillation or episodes of skipped beats which don’t happen all the time.

**Cardiac event recorders**

If you have symptoms that don’t happen frequently, your doctor might suggest having a cardiac event recorder or an implantable loop recorder (ILR) inserted. This records the heart's activity for a longer period of time, or whenever symptoms occur.

An ILR is implanted under the skin on your chest in a minor surgical procedure done under local anaesthetic. An ILR can continuously monitor your heartbeat for up to three years and help find out what may be causing your symptoms - such as dizzy spells or blackouts.

This is particularly useful for people who have symptoms that haven’t been picked up through a standard ECG or Holter monitor."

Your privacy will be maintained as you will be behind curtains or in a hospital clinic room in the outpatients department.

With a standard echo, sometimes called a transthoracic echo or TTE, you’ll be asked to lie on a couch or bed. A gel used especially for scanning will be used to help the sound waves reach your heart. It feels cold and sticky, but is otherwise harmless.

The healthcare professional (called a sonographer) doing the procedure will move the probe in different areas of your chest around your heart. The probe gives off pulses of high frequency sound waves which pass through your skin to your heart. The ultrasound waves ‘echo’ against the structures of your heart and the probe picks up these reflections and shows them as images on a screen.

Different parts of the heart are seen as the probe is moved around on your chest."

A transoesophageal echocardiography, or TOE, takes detailed pictures of your heart from your oesophagus (the tube that connects your throat to your stomach) which lies behind your heart. This test is used to get closer and more defined images of the heart as it can detect things that are not as easy to see with a transthoracic echo.

You will be asked to lie on your side and ‘swallow’ a small probe which is mounted at the end of a flexible tube. A local anaesthetic that numbs the area will be sprayed onto the back of your throat and you will be offered a short-acting light sedative to help you relax. The procedure usually takes about 30 minutes.

The technician will obtain the images they need and remove the tube as soon as the procedure is done.

**Stress echocardiogram**

An echocardiogram may be done while the heart is beating faster – a stress echo is performed while deliberately increasing the heart rate with either exercise on a treadmill or stationary bike, or with medication given through a vein. This test can help to diagnose coronary heart disease as it shows the coronary arteries in the heart aren’t getting as much oxygen rich blood as they should.

**Foetal echocardiogram**

Foetal echocardiograms are used to help identify heart defects before a child is born.

**Bubble echo**

This is sometimes called a bubble study.

A bubble echo involves performing an echo in the usual way whilst a small amount of salt water (saline) is injected into your bloodstream, through a vein in your arm. The salt water contains tiny bubbles which show up clearly on the scan pictures, and can be a useful way to identify a hole in the heart. It may be carried out after a stroke or TIA, or after complex heart surgery.

The test is quick and painless, and the bubbles are harmless."

It’s used to diagnose and treat a wide variety of abnormal heart rhythms.

An EP study is carried out in a cath lab by a specialist cardiac doctor called an electrophysiologist. It usually takes about 2-3 hours, but can take longer. You’ll be asked not to eat or drink anything for a few hours beforehand.

- Thin flexible tubes called catheters are inserted into a vein, usually in the groin. You’ll have a local anaesthetic injection to numb the area where the catheters are put in. You may also be given a sedative to help you relax during the procedure.
- The catheters are passed up to the heart. This can induce an arrhythmia (an abnormal heart rhythm).
- You may feel lightheaded or like you’re having palpitations. You may also feel a sensation or discomfort in your chest. You should tell the staff if you experience any symptoms."

You will be asked to stay in bed for a few hours after the test but most people can go home after this.

It’s normal to feel tired afterwards, but you should feel back to normal within a few days.

If the cause of your abnormal heart rhythm is found, the doctor will sometimes proceed to treat the problem by doing a catheter ablation. This treatment uses either heat (radio-frequency ablation) or freezing (cryogenic ablation) to destroy the areas inside the heart which are causing the abnormal rhythm and therefore relieve the symptoms. This may be done at the same time as the EP study."

When your device recognises something unusual, it will either begin recording your heart’s activity automatically, or you might need to:

- Manually start the recording using a small, hand-held activator machine when you feel symptoms
- Use a mobile phone app to manually record the activity.

If your device needs you to use an activator, hold it over the area of your chest where you ILR is, and it will begin recording. Your healthcare team will tell you if you can use the mobile phone app for your device and how to use it, or show you how to use your activator before you go home.

- You’ll be asked to lie still while the scan is taking place.
- The scan may last for up to an hour, but there’s a buzzer you can press if you need to speak to the radiographer (the person operating the scanner).
- The scanner is quite noisy. You’ll be able to hear banging sounds but you’ll usually be offered earplugs or earphones so you can listen to music.
- For some cardiac MRIs the doctor will use a dye known as contrast agent so that the images of blood flow to your heart show up more clearly on the scan. The dye will be injected into a vein in your arm. Your doctor will give you more information about this if it’s required.

A camera will be positioned close to your chest to take pictures of different parts of your heart, similar to an x-ray.

The scan is usually in two parts – stress and rest – so that doctors can see the effects of stress (exercise) on your heart.

For the stress element, before you are injected with the tracer you will be asked to exercise on a bike or treadmill. If you are unable to exercise you may be given a medicine instead which increases your heart rate. The camera takes pictures of your heart while you are exercising and your heart rate and blood pressure will be closely monitored throughout.

You will then have a break of about an hour, in which you will be asked to drink plenty to clear the radiation from your system.

It uses either heat (radiofrequency ablation) or freezing (cryoablation) on the area of your heart that’s causing the abnormal heart rhythm (or arrhythmia). This treatment creates scar tissue which:

breaks abnormal circuits in the heart
destroys areas of the heart muscle which are triggering arrhythmias. 
An ablation is started using the same technique as an electrophysiology (EP) study and is often carried out at the same time. The EP study can discover if you have extra electrical pathways in your heart that could be causing your abnormal heart rhythm."

After around 8 – 10 weeks it’ll be clear whether it’s worked or not.

If it’s a success, your doctor will discuss stopping some of your medication.

You will probably feel tired afterwards, but most people begin to feel back to normal after a few days.

Most people can begin to drive after a few days, your doctor will let you know when it is safe for you to drive. It might depend on the type of procedure you had and what type of vehicle you drive.

You should avoid heavy lifting for at least two weeks after your treatment.

Some people may feel tired for several weeks after an ablation. It can feel worrying if it takes you longer than you expected to feel back to normal. But, everybody’s recovery is different.

Your doctor will explain any risks before you give your consent to have the procedure. Your doctor will only recommend that you have this procedure if they think the benefits outweigh the risks.

The procedure can sometimes cause a little bleeding where the catheter was inserted. Some bruising is expected but you may develop a small collection of blood under the skin – known as a haematoma. If the wound site becomes very red and swollen contact your GP.

There is a small risk of damage to the heart's normal electrical pathways. If this happens, you may need to be fitted with a pacemaker to stop your heart from beating too slowly."

This means your heart isn't pumping as much blood and oxygen around your body as it should.

If your condition isn’t improving and other treatments aren't helping, your cardiologist might send you for a transplant assessment. A transplant assessment might include blood tests, antibody tests and tests of your heart, lungs and blood vessels.

Ask your doctor about these tests before you go for your assessment to get prepared. Based on the transplant assessment, you might be:

suitable for a transplant, in which case you will be put onto the active transplant waiting list. This means you might be called for a transplant at any time
potentially suitable for a transplant, but your current condition isn't severe enough to put you on the waiting list. If this happens your case will be looked at regularly. If your condition gets worse, you'll then go on the waiting list
in need of further investigations or treatment. This means more information is needed before a decision is made

living a longer life
a better quality of life
more energy.
Around three quarters of UK heart transplant patients live for at least 5 years. However, there can be complications (problems) before, during and after surgery. The most common complications include:

when your body tries to reject the donor heart because it knows it’s a different heart
infections – serious infections are rare, but chest and urine are the most common. You’ll may be treated with antibiotics if this happens
problems with your kidneys
high blood pressure
diabetes
a higher risk of some forms of cancer.

First, your doctor will assess you and place you on one of three waiting lists:

routine – if you’re relatively healthy

urgent – if you’re unwell

super-urgent – if you’re critically ill

Although you’ll usually receive a transplant quicker if you’re on a more urgent list, this doesn’t always happen. You can move up a list if you become more ill.

Whether you’re offered a donor heart can depend on:

which waiting list you’re on
how long you’ve been waiting
how much the heart will benefit you
if your blood type matches a donor heart
if your height and weight is like a donor’s (to match the size of the donor heart)
if you have antibodies that may react with a donor heart (antibodies sometimes reject donor hearts).
Donor hearts can come from anywhere in the UK or sometimes other countries in Western Europe. The transplant team will try to guess how long you might wait. A suitable heart could be available within days or it might take months or even years.

Unfortunately, around one in six people don’t receive the heart transplant they need. While there’s nothing you can do about the wait, you can give yourself the best chance at being ready for the surgery and recovery by preparing yourself.

Preparing yourself includes managing the worry or difficult feelings of waiting in a good way, reducing stress, doing things you enjoy and staying fit. Find out how to get in shape for surgery with our five tips.

Some patients being considered for a heart transplant may need to have a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), if their cardiologist thinks they need it to survive until a suitable donor heart becomes available. This device helps pump blood around the body."

Accepting or rejecting an offer is up to you and your transplant team who will advise you on what they think is best. If you don’t accept an offer, the donor organ will be offered to someone else and you’ll be placed back on the list to wait for another match.

Not every donor organ has to be accepted by you and the transplant team. This can be for reasons, like:

if the organ isn’t from the right type of donor (donor organs come with different risks like how long they’ll last – this is a discussion you’ll have when you join a waiting list)
if the organ is at a higher risk of failing

Your surgeon will think about the best way to do the transplant for you. The steps they’ll usually follow are:

at the start of the procedure, you’ll be given a general anaesthetic (a medicine to put you to sleep)
the surgeon will make a cut in your breastbone (the middle of the chest) to get to your heart
you'll be connected to a heart-lung bypass machine. This keeps your heart and lung going during the operation, pumping blood around your body
your surgeon will then work on the transplant
when this is finished, they'll start your heart beating again
when your heart begins to take over pumping and your condition is steady, the heart-lung machine will be turned off
the surgeon will then close your breastbone by stitching it with wire, which will stay there for the rest of your life.
After the operation you'll be moved to the intensive care unit. Most people wake up the day after, but it can take a little longer as the anaesthetic wears off.

You'll be given medicine and a ventilator machine which helps you breathe until you can do it yourself. From there, you’ll be moved into a high dependency unit or a ‘step down’ ward which is for people who need a higher level of care than normal."

A member of the transplant team will prepare you for going home and talk about your aftercare.

To make sure your heart transplant is as successful as possible, you may need to make changes to your lifestyle. Here are some things you can do to help your recovery:

attend all your appointments – it’s important to go even if you feel well so doctors can check how you’re doing and change medications if needed
keep your surgery wound clean and dry
take your medication exactly as prescribed. Contact your transplant team if you have problems with your medications or if you are not sure how or when to take them
wear sunblock when you go outside and spend less time in the sun during hot parts of the year. After a transplant you’re at a higher risk of developing skin cancer
don’t smoke – this is a fresh start to keep your heart healthy
do regular exercise - such as walking around your home and building up to short walks outside
eat a healthy, balanced diet – start by getting 1-2 portions of fruit and veg with every meal and avoid too much sugar, saturated fats and salt
aim to control your cholesterol and blood pressure levels - swap saturated fats (butter, processed meats, biscuits) for unsaturated fats (olive oil, oily fish, nuts), maintaining a healthy weight, and reduce salt in your diet.
Another important way to recover is to be aware of personal and food hygiene to avoid getting an infection. You can do this by:

avoiding anyone who has an infection, including cold, flu and Covid
not eating high-risk foods that could cause food poisoning such as raw eggs, mayonnaise, raw meats, unpasteurised milk and cheeses, and shellfish
keeping your pets healthy, wormed, and vaccinated so you don’t pick up any parasites or germs that can cause illness. You should also avoid changing cat litter trays (the infection toxoplasmosis is carried by cats)
washing your hands after gardening or if you have been handling any pets to avoid picking up parasites and germs.
It’s a good idea to get onto a cardiac rehab programme. Cardiac rehab can help you to recover as quickly as possible and talk about your experience with others who've been through similar. The programme includes supervised exercise and advice on how to lead a healthy lifestyle. We also have an at home programme available so check with your team if this is suitable for you."

You may find it helpful to write down or have someone with you to help remember the information you get throughout your journey.

It’s okay to feel low after surgery, like many people do. The transplant team can help you if you want to talk with them. Don't forget to talk to family or friends about how you feel.

Your recovery depends on you, so talk with your doctor about when you might be able to do some of these activities.

You'll need to take several medicines, including immunosuppressants (also known as anti-rejection medicines), for the rest of your life. Without them your body would think your new heart was ‘foreign’ and try to reject it. This type of medicine can have side-effects, and there may also be medications that you can't take with it. Speak to your doctor about your medication.

After the operation, you'll have a wound along your breastbone that will heal over time. It’s normal to be worried or scared about having scars after surgery. Listen to others who tell us how they learned to accept their scars.

If you’re thinking of starting a family after a heart transplant, it’s very important that you talk with your transplant team before you try. This is so they can personally advise you on the risks, planning and medications involved. You can also speak to them about similar topics like contraception and hormone replacement therapy (HRT)."
"['what are the heart valves?', 'how would you define the heart valves?', 'can you explain the concept of heart valves?', 'what do the heart valves refer to?', 'what is the meaning of heart valves?', 'how do you describe the heart valves?']","Your heart is made up of four connected chambers (or sections) that take in and pump out blood. For each chamber, there is a valve with small flaps of skin that open and close to let blood through in the right direction. These are the:

aortic valve 
mitral valve 
pulmonary valve 
tricuspid valve"
"['why is heart valve surgery done?', 'what is the purpose behind performing heart valve surgery?', 'why would someone undergo heart valve surgery?', 'what are the reasons for undergoing heart valve surgery?', 'what prompts the need for heart valve surgery?', 'what are the motivations for conducting heart valve surgery?']","Heart valve surgery is done when one or more of your valves is diseased or damaged. If you have one of these issues, it can affect how your blood flows through your heart in two ways:

if your valve doesn't open fully or becomes stiff, it will block the flow of blood. This is called valve stenosis or narrowing
if the valve doesn't close properly, it will allow blood to leak backwards. This is called valve incompetence, regurgitation, or a leaky valve.
Both stenosis and regurgitation can put extra strain on your heart because your heart must pump harder to push the blood through the valves. Symptoms of these issues include:

chest pain
dizziness and fainting
palpitations (a pounding or fluttering in the chest)
shortness of breath

However, your cardiologist will check to see if you're suitable for surgery based on your condition. Surgery might be the best option if it’ll improve your symptoms and quality of life by a long way.

If your doctor believes surgery is the best option, you will get a valve repair or a valve replacement.

valve repair is used for valves that become floppy and leak but aren't seriously damaged. If it’s possible to repair the valve, your surgeon may do this rather than replace it
valve replacement is when the old valve is replaced with a new valve. The most common types of replacement valves are mechanical (artificial) valves or tissue (animal) valves.
In some cases, a Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure may be used if you're an adult and not well enough to have traditional heart surgery. This is a less invasive way of performing valve surgery and is a newer treatment option. Speak with your surgeon about the advantages and disadvantages of this type of surgery as it's not suitable for everyone.

Whether or not you have heart valve surgery, and whether the operation is a repair or a replacement will depend on many things. These include the cause of the problem, which valve is affected, how badly the valve is affected, how many valves are affected, your symptoms, and your general health."

There are two options for a new valve:
mechanical (artificial) – valves made of mechanical parts. These valves last a long time and are usually recommended to younger patients. However, blood clots can form more easily so anticoagulants like warfarin must be taken for the rest of your life
tissue (animal) – valves mostly made of tissue taken from humans, pigs or cows. These are safe to insert, last from 15 to 20 years, and mean you won’t have to take anticoagulants (blood thinning medications) for the rest of your life."

Your risk depends on your age, your current state of health and the level of your valve disease. Common risks include:

atrial fibrillation (an abnormal heart rhythm) after surgery. This usually gets better with treatment
bleeding – you may need a further operation after surgery to control bleeding
death – the risk of not surviving the operation will be higher if you’re very unwell before the surgery. You can discuss this with your surgeon at your consultation
renal (kidney) failure – this is more common if you already have kidney problems and can be treated with dialysis.
stroke – this happens when a blood clot develops and travels to the brain, cutting off the oxygen supply. The risk is higher if you have had a stroke or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs, commonly known as mini-strokes). To reduce the risk of stroke, you’ll be given medications during and after the operation. You may have to wear special stockings after your operation which can help reduce the risk of clots
wound infection – this is more common if you have poorly controlled diabetes or other conditions that mean you’re more at risk of infection. If you do get an infection, this can be treated with antibiotics.
Talk to your surgeon before the procedure and ask any questions you may have about both the benefits and risks of the operation. 

If you have a heart valve problem or have had surgery on your valve, you're at risk of endocarditis. You're also at risk if you have had endocarditis before. Endocarditis is inflammation of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium) caused by bacteria that enters your bloodstream and finds its way to the heart, including the valves and the endocardium."

This is because your body's natural reaction to an artificial material is to try and ‘fix’ it which is when a clot can form. You'll be told how long you need to the medication and the doctor will discuss changes to any medication you're currently on. 

If you have a tissue valve replacement, you may need to take anticoagulants for a shorter period. This may be from a few weeks to 2-3 months after surgery.

The most commonly prescribed anticoagulant is called warfarin. Watch this video to find out more about warfarin, its possible side effects and what it does in your body.

It sends electrical pulses to regulate abnormal heart rhythms, especially those that could be dangerous and cause a cardiac arrest. 

The heart has its own electrical system that regulates the heartbeat. With every heartbeat, there's an electrical signal that travels through your heart, causing it to contract and pump blood. If this doesn’t happen properly, you could have an abnormal heart rhythm (or arrhythmia) and you may need an ICD fitted."

Thin wires connect the ICD to the heart, where it's always checking your heart rate and rhythm. It monitors your heart rhythm through the electrodes.

If an ICD notices a dangerous heart rhythm it can deliver one or more of the following treatments:

Pacing – a series of low-voltage electrical impulses (paced beats) at a fast rate to try and correct the heart rhythm.
Cardioversion – one or more small electric shocks to try and restore the heart to a normal rhythm.
Defibrillation – one or more larger electric shocks to try and restore the heart to a normal rhythm."

It can take anything from one hour to three or more hours to implant an ICD. The time it takes will depend on the type of device you are given. You'll often (but not always) need to stay overnight in hospital and your ICD will be checked thoroughly before you leave.
The ICD is inserted just under your collar bone. It looks similar to a pacemaker and is a little bigger than a matchbox. 

An ICD is made up of:
a pulse generator – a battery powered electronic circuit
one or more electrode leads, which are placed into your heart through a vein.
A different type of ICD is suitable for some people. It's called a subcutaneous (under the skin) ICD – or SICD for short. An SICD works in the same way as an ICD, but it's inserted under the skin of the chest (outside of the ribcage) and there are no leads placed into the heart.

Some ICD checks may be done remotely with the information from your ICD sent via a signal on the device or a home docking station to your health care professional, so there is sometimes no need to attend hospital.

You may have to make some changes to your lifestyle, for instance, if you drive or take part in contact sports. You also need to be aware of how some electronic devices, such as TENS machines or airport security systems, can affect your ICD."

This allows the camera to easily see the heart's structure and blood flow. This causes a warm, flushing sensation throughout the body lasting a few seconds which some people may find strange, but isn’t painful.

You will then be asked to lie on a bed which passes through the CT scanner. The length of the test depends on the type of scanner used and why you are having the scan."

It plays an important role in how our cells work and helps your body make vitamin D and hormones which keep your bones, teeth and muscles healthy.

Having too much cholesterol can clog your arteries, causing problems like heart disease. There are two main types of cholesterol:

‘good cholesterol’ (called high-density lipoproteins or HDL) which take cholesterol you don’t need back to the liver
‘bad cholesterol’ (called non-high-density lipoproteins or non-HDL) which can lead to fatty layers building up in your arteries that block the flow of blood to and from the heart. This can increase your risk of getting heart problems."

They’re one of the most prescribed drugs in the UK, with an estimated 7-8 million adults taking them.

Lots of people don’t need a strong statin to reduce their cholesterol level. Your GP or cardiologist will find the right statin for you, depending on your medical history and the cholesterol level they want you to aim for.

The different types of statins your doctor might prescribe include:

atorvastatin (Lipitor)
fluvastatin (Lescol)
pravastatin (Lipostat)
rosuvastatin (Crestor)
simvastatin (Zocor).

have diabetes
have had a heart attack or stroke
have had an angioplasty or bypass surgery

It improves the blood flow in your heart by replacing an aortic valve that doesn’t open fully.

TAVI can also be called Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). There is no difference between TAVI and TAVR – they are just different names for the same procedure. TAVI is more commonly used in the UK, TAVR in the USA.

TAVI is a common, mostly painless procedure. A narrow flexible tube (called a catheter) is put into a blood vessel in your upper leg or chest and is passed towards your aortic valve in your heart. The tube is used to fix a replacement valve over the top of your old one."

Your heart valves play an important role in keeping blood flowing through your heart. The aortic valve opens to let blood flow from your heart to your aorta. The aorta is the big vessel supplying your body with oxygen-rich blood.

If you have severe aortic stenosis, you may need to replace your aortic valve.

TAVI was originally used as an alternative to heart valve surgery for people who weren’t well enough to have open heart surgery to replace their aortic valves. But TAVI is now being used for people at lower risk of complications from heart surgery because research is showing it’s at least as effective as heart valve surgery after one year. TAVI is also showing signs of working over a longer period, but more research is needed before it becomes the first choice for patients with severe aortic stenosis.

We encourage you to discuss with your doctor whether TAVI or heart valve surgery is right for you. They should talk through your options and listen carefully to your views and concerns before you agree to having the procedure. Your family can be involved too, if you wish. It can feel hard to ask questions about difficult topics such as risks and life expectancy, but most people feel better once they do.

To help decide whether TAVI is right for you, you may have one or more of the following tests:

Blood tests
Echocardiogram
ECG
CT scans
Coronary angiogram
Trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE)
Chest X-ray
Breathing tests
Many people feel scared to have tests or worry they will hurt but the tests are normally quick and painless. Your doctor or nurse will talk you through what each test involves and can answer any questions."

A smaller number of people may have complications after a TAVI procedure. The risk varies depending on your overall health and your individual heart condition.

You can improve your chances of long-term success and reduce the risks of TAVI by making healthy lifestyle changes, including: 

Eating more healthily
Getting more physically active  
Giving up smoking 
Cutting down on alcohol  
Taking prescribed medicine 
Keeping teeth and gums clean and healthy (this is the most common route that bacteria enter the bloodstream)

relief from or less tiredness  
relief from or less dizziness and fainting
more energy – with better blood flow through your heart, everyday tasks and physical activities become easier and more enjoyable

blood clots and strokes – although following TAVI you’ll be given anti-clotting drugs to reduce your risk 
Rarer risks of TAVI include: 

a heart attack during the procedure
kidney problems for the first few days
endocarditis – where the inner lining of heart chambers and valves becomes infected
death (although the risk is far lower than the risks of leaving severe aortic stenosis untreated)
A small number of people will need open heart surgery to correct complications that happen during the TAVI procedure.

In comparison with open heart aortic valve surgery, TAVI has a greater risk of people needing a pacemaker permanently fitted afterwards.

You'll change into your gown and will be asked to remove any jewellery that might get in the way
You will usually be awake and lying on your back for the TAVI. You’ll be given a medicine called a sedative to help you relax
You’ll be given a local anaesthetic injection so you won’t feel any pain in your upper leg or under your collar bone. A thin tube (the catheter) is then passed into your artery through the numbed area
The tube is then passed into the opening in your aortic valve and a new valve, made of metal and animal tissue, is positioned inside the old valve
The valve either expands by itself or a balloon at the end of the catheter tube may be blown up to make room for the new valve
During your procedure, you’ll be closely watched by your healthcare team. You will be attached to a heart monitor that records your heart rate and rhythm and you’ll have a clip measuring your oxygen levels on your finger. You’ll also have your blood pressure checked regularly
Many people experience a feeling of pressure during the TAVI. If you feel unwell, or have chest pain at any time, tell the team

Any changes to any other medication you are on will also be discussed. If you have any concerns about your medication after you leave hospital, speak to your GP or pharmacist.

Once you leave hospital, you will probably have a TAVI nurse that can offer support and/or be invited to cardiac rehab.

It takes people different periods of time to recover after a TAVI procedure. Most people take about six to ten weeks to feel fully recovered.

A few weeks after the procedure, you will probably have a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist at the TAVI centre. After this your local cardiologist or GP normally takes over your care.

Recovering from a TAVI can be emotionally difficult as well as physically. People often tell us they've felt low, frustrated and detached from others after big health events like this. It's very normal and the feelings usually improve as you recover.

If your chest pain doesn’t stop after a few minutes’ rest, and one or two doses of your nitrate medication, you should call 999 immediately because this could be a heart attack. "
"['what types of angina are there?', 'what are the different classifications of angina?', 'can you list the various types of angina?', 'what are the distinct categories of angina?', 'how is angina categorized into different types?', 'what classifications exist for angina?']","There are several types of angina including:
- stable angina
- unstable angina
- vasospastic angina
- microvascular angina. "
"['what is stable angina?', 'how would you define stable angina?', 'can you explain the concept of stable angina?', 'what characterizes stable angina?', 'what is the meaning of stable angina?', 'how do you describe stable angina?']","This is the most common type of angina. It tends to happen when your heart works harder, such as when you’re walking uphill, and goes away when you rest. 
You’ll usually know when it’s likely to happen and the pain or discomfort is similar to what you’ve had before. 
Stable angina lasts five minutes or less, and improves if you rest or take your medication. "
"['what is unstable angina?', 'how would you define unstable angina?', 'can you explain the concept of unstable angina?', 'what characterizes unstable angina?', 'what is the meaning of unstable angina?', 'how do you describe unstable angina?']","Unstable angina can feel different to your normal angina symptoms. It can happen even when you’re resting. Unstable angina feels more severe and lasts longer. Your symptoms might not improve when you rest or take medication. 
If your symptoms don’t improve when you rest of take medication, you should call 999 immediately. "
"['what is vasospastic angina?', 'how would you define vasospastic angina?', 'can you explain the concept of vasospastic angina?', 'what characterizes vasospastic angina?', 'what is the meaning of vasospastic angina?', 'how do you describe vasospastic angina?']","Also known as coronary artery spasm or Prinzmetal’s angina, Vasospastic angina is rare. It can happen during the night when you’re resting, when a coronary artery supplying blood and oxygen to your heart goes into spasm and narrows or tightens, and lets less blood through."
"['what is microvascular angina?', 'how would you define microvascular angina?', 'can you explain the concept of microvascular angina?', 'what characterizes microvascular angina?', 'what is the meaning of microvascular angina?', 'how do you describe microvascular angina?']","Microvascular angina (also known as cardiac syndrome X) usually happens when you're under physical pressure, like when you're exercising, or you’ve been stressed or anxious. The pain is often caused by spasms in the smallest coronary arteries restricting blood flow.  "
"['are angina symptoms the same for men and women?', 'do men and women experience similar symptoms of angina?', 'are the symptoms of angina the same in both men and women?', 'do angina symptoms differ between men and women?', 'are the signs of angina identical for both men and women?', 'do men and women exhibit comparable angina symptoms?']","Both men and women can experience the same symptoms of angina. These include ‘classic’ chest pain, and pain in the jaw, neck, back or tummy.  
But in general, women are more likely than men to develop:
- less common symptoms like feeling sick, sweaty, dizzy and breathless
- microvascular angina – spasms in the smallest coronary arteries."
"['what causes angina? ', 'what are the underlying factors that lead to angina?', 'what are the potential causes of angina?', 'what triggers the occurrence of angina?', 'what are the contributing factors to the development of angina?', 'what physiological or pathological mechanisms are responsible for angina?']","The most common cause is coronary heart disease. This is when the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood and oxygen are narrowed by a fatty substance called plaque. It means less blood flows to your heart muscle and can cause angina symptoms. 
There are common triggers for angina pain, like:
- physical activity
- emotional stress
- cold weather
- eating a meal.
Panic attacks or feeling anxious can cause chest pain . If you experience this, it isn’t angina. Anxiety isn’t caused by a problem with your blood flow, whereas angina is."
"['is angina hereditary?', 'can angina be inherited?', 'are there genetic factors involved in angina?', 'does angina have a hereditary component?', 'is there a familial link to angina?', 'can angina be passed down through generations?']","No, angina is not an inherited condition. It won’t be found in a genetic test. But if your grandparents, parents, siblings or children have angina then you have what’s called a strong family history of the condition. This can increase your chance of developing a heart condition that could cause angina too. Find out more about family histories of heart conditions and how you can reduce your risk."

"['what’s the treatment for angina?', 'what are the available treatment options for angina?', 'how is angina typically treated?', 'what are the common approaches to treating angina?', 'what are the recommended therapies for managing angina?', 'what treatment modalities are used to address angina?']","- Medication, such as nitrate sprays, patches and pills may help control your symptoms. Your doctor might also suggest you take medication to reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke.
- Some people need treatments such as a coronary angioplasty where a special kind of balloon is gently inflated to open a narrowed artery. Many people also have a type of mesh called a stent inserted to keep the artery open. Heart bypass surgery may also be an option.
- Simple lifestyle changes may help reduce your symptoms of angina, improve your overall health and reduce your risk of a heart attack in the future."
"['what is an angiogram?', 'how would you define an angiogram?', 'what does the term ""angiogram"" refer to?', 'can you explain the concept of an angiogram?', 'what is the meaning of an angiogram?', 'how can an angiogram be described?']","An angiogram (also known as a cardiac catheterisation) is a special type of x-ray which uses contrast dye to allow your doctor to look at your coronary arteries (the blood vessels that supply your heart).
The dye lets your doctor see how well the blood is flowing and shows up any narrowings.
Depending on your results, the procedure can help your doctor decide what treatment you might need.
An angiogram can sometimes also be helpful for investigating other conditions, such as congenital heart disease."

You can expect the test to last around half an hour, although it can sometimes take longer. You will need to lie flat for the procedure.
- You will be asked not to eat or drink anything for a few hours before your procedure.
- You’ll be given a local anaesthetic injection in the wrist or groin. The catheter (a thin, flexible tube) will then be passed into an artery.
- The catheter will be directed through your blood vessels and up to your heart. The doctors will use X-ray to help guide them to the arteries.
- A special dye called contrast will then be passed through the catheter and a series of images will be taken. It is very common to feel a hot, flushing sensation as the dye enters your bloodstream, but this is completely normal and only lasts for a few seconds. The dye will show up any narrowed areas or blockages in the artery on the X-ray.
- During your procedure, you’ll be attached to a heart monitor that records your heart rate and rhythm and you’ll have a probe measuring your oxygen levels on your finger. If you feel unwell or uncomfortable at any time, you should tell a member of the hospital staff."
"['what happens after an angiogram?', 'what occurs following an angiogram?', 'what transpires after undergoing an angiogram?', 'what is the sequence of events following an angiogram?', 'what takes place after the completion of an angiogram?', 'what follows after an angiogram procedure?']","After the procedure, the catheter will be removed and a collagen plug called an angioseal will be left in place. This is common if the procedure is performed through the groin. You will need to stay on bedrest for about an hour. Some doctors prefer to apply a pressure pad to the wound, in which case you will need to stay on bedrest a bit longer, usually around 4 hours.  
If your procedure is performed through your wrist, a pressure device to reduce the risk of bleeding is left in place and the nurses will gradually reduce the pressure over a short period of time then remove it altogether. You will be able to sit in a chair almost straight away.
The nurses will check your blood pressure and pulse and keep an eye on your wound. It is important to drink plenty of fluid as this helps to flush the dye out of your system.
As long as you feel well, you should be able to go home the same day, although this may depend on the results. Your doctor will explain these to you before you leave.
The most common after-effect is bruising at the site where the catheter was inserted which may feel tender and numb for a few days. You might feel tired, but you should be back to normal within a few days. If you are worried about any of the after-effects, contact your doctor.
Some people who have a coronary angiogram go on to have a treatment called coronary angioplasty."

A CT scan is a modern, sophisticated type of X-ray.
A CT coronary angiogram shows the blood flow through the coronary arteries. For this test the dye is injected into a small vein in your arm. This makes the test less invasive than a traditional angiogram. 
You will then lie on a bed which passes through a doughnut-shaped opening in a CT scanner to show detailed images of your heart. Some people feel a bit claustrophobic during this test, so let the team know if you feel nervous.
A CT coronary angiogram is generally not as reliable at detecting narrowings in small coronary arteries or in small branches as a traditional coronary angiogram. This means that the standard coronary angiogram is still the ‘gold standard’ for diagnosing coronary heart disease."

Serious complications are rare and your doctor will discuss these before you have it done.
Following an angiogram, some people may develop a collection of blood under the skin, which is called a haematoma. This can be uncomfortable and cause bruising, but it should go down after a few days. However, contact your doctor if you have any concerns.
A small amount of radiation is used during an angiogram. The doctor will bear this in mind if you have been exposed to higher levels than normal.

"[""what's atherosclerosis?"", 'how would you define atherosclerosis?', 'what is the meaning of atherosclerosis?', 'can you explain what atherosclerosis is?', 'what does the term ""atherosclerosis"" refer to?', 'how is atherosclerosis typically described?']","Atherosclerosis is a common condition that can affect anyone, particularly if you’re over 65 or have a family history of heart or circulatory diseases. It’s caused by a build-up of fatty material called atheroma (or plaque) in your artery walls (where blood passes from the heart to the rest of the body).
Atheroma builds up as the walls of your arteries harden and narrow until blood can’t pass properly from your heart to the rest of your body. Many people don’t know they have atherosclerosis since atheroma takes time to build up and often doesn’t cause symptoms until it’s serious.
Lifestyle, health conditions and family history all effect whether you’ll get it. Atherosclerosis isn’t reversible but lifestyle choices are important in preventing the risk and improving the symptoms of it."

- angina – usually a pain or discomfort in your chest that happens when your heart muscle isn’t getting enough blood 
- coronary heart disease - when the main arteries of your heart become narrowed or blocked by fatty material (plaque) by a build-up of fatty material within their walls.
- heart attack – if the fatty material breaks down and becomes a blood clot, it can block your artery and cut off the supply of blood to your heart
- stroke - when enough blood can’t get to your brain. If the blood supply is limited for a short time, this can cause a mini-stroke (called a TIA). If the fatty material breaks down and becomes a blood clot, it can block the artery and cause a stroke
- peripheral arterial disease (or PAD) – when enough blood can’t get to your leg muscles. This can cause pain in your calves, hips, buttocks and thighs – usually when you’re walking or exercising."

- chest pain 
- confusion, as a result of blood not flowing to your brain 
- difficulty breathing 
- feeling very tired

However, there are some factors that can increase your chances of getting it, such as:
- a family history of atherosclerosis or other heart problems
- being overweight or obese
- conditions like high cholesterol, diabetes or high blood pressure (which increase your risk of having heart and circulatory diseases)
- drinking too much alcohol (more than the recommend weekly amount of 14 units)
- ethnicity - research has shown that people of some ethnicities (Black Africans, African Caribbean's and South Asians) in the UK are at higher risk of developing high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes. Both of these conditions increase your risk of having heart and circulatory disease

If you can, find out if you have a family history of atherosclerosis or heart disease so your doctor gets a full picture. The tests may include:
- blood tests - to check your cholesterol and overall health
- carotid ultrasound – a test that makes pictures of the insides of the two largest arteries in your neck (called the carotid arteries)
- CT scan/coronary calcium scoring – a scan of the heart to see how much plaque has built up in the arteries of your heart
- coronary angiogram – a special x-ray using dye to see the blood flow in your heart

You’ll be given local anaesthetic at the start of the procedure. A narrow flexible tube (called a catheter) is put into your wrist or groin (the area of your hip between your stomach and thigh) and pushed up to the coronary artery. A small balloon at the end of the tube is blown up to widen the narrowed part of your artery.
Sometimes if the artery is so narrow that the balloon can’t pass through it, a tiny drill might also be used (this is called rotablation) to chip away at the fatty deposits, to gradually widen the narrowing.
Most of the time angioplasty is combined with putting in a small metal mesh tube (called a stent). When the balloon is deflated and the catheter tube and balloon are removed, the stent stays in place, acting like a scaffold to keep your artery open.
You may hear your doctor call coronary angioplasty with stenting a PCI. PCI is a medical abbreviation (name) for percutaneous coronary intervention."

But in some people, fatty deposits can build up and narrow or block the coronary arteries (this is called atherosclerosis, which can cause coronary heart disease). If not enough blood is flowing through the coronary arteries, this can lead to angina or a heart attack.
Coronary angioplasty widens narrowed coronary arteries. This procedure is used:
- In severe cases of angina, where medication isn’t working
- As an emergency treatment for people during a heart attack
Angioplasty isn’t for everyone. Depending on your health and individual heart conditions, you may be advised that you need coronary artery bypass surgery."

Many people find their symptoms get better and they’re able to do more.
Sometimes the artery can become narrowed again (restenosis), causing angina symptoms. But advances in stent technology mean that the risk of this happening is getting lower. Many people are now symptom-free for a long time.
You can improve your chances of long-term success by making healthy lifestyle changes, including:

You’ll usually be awake during the procedure.
- You’ll be asked not to eat or drink for four to six hours before the angioplasty
- You'll change into your gown and will be asked to remove any jewellery that might get in the way.
- You will usually be awake and lying on your back for the angioplasty. You may be given a sedative to help you relax – talk to your doctor about this if you are nervous.
- You’ll be given a local anaesthetic injection in your wrist or groin. A thin tube (the catheter) is then passed into your artery through the numbed area.
- A special dye (called a contrast dye) is injected into the tube so that your coronary arteries can be seen on an x-ray screen. This part is called an angiogram. It’s normal to feel a flushing sensation when the dye enters your bloodstream – for some people, this might feel as though they are weeing themselves.
- During your procedure, you’ll be attached to a heart monitor that records your heart rate and rhythm and you’ll have a clip measuring your oxygen levels on your finger. You’ll also have your blood pressure checked regularly.

- you get any pain, redness or swelling
- or if the bruising worsens
- or if you develop a temperature

Before you leave hospital, someone will have a chat with you about your recovery and what you can and can’t do. It’s normal to feel tired afterwards but most people find that they’re back to normal after a few days. However, if you’ve also had a heart attack, it will take longer to recover.
If you’ve had a stent fitted, you’ll be given medicines to help reduce the risk of blood clots forming in and around the stent. They may include:
- aspirin
- anti-platelet medication such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel
You may also be asked to take cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins.
If you’ve had an emergency angioplasty, you may be invited to go on a cardiac rehab programme, a course of exercise and information sessions that help you to recover as quickly as possible.

"['what is diabetes?', 'how can diabetes be defined?', 'what does the term ""diabetes"" refer to?', 'what is meant by the term ""diabetes""?', 'how can we describe diabetes?', 'what constitutes diabetes?']","Diabetes is a life-long condition that causes your blood sugar levels to become too high. 
Sugar in the blood is also known as glucose, it’s your body’s main source of energy. It comes from the food you eat, particularly carbohydrates like bread and potatoes. 
Glucose is carried through the bloodstream to cells around the body to give them energy to work. When there’s glucose in the bloodstream, the pancreas (an organ near the stomach) makes a hormone (a chemical messenger) called insulin. Insulin tells the body’s cells to absorb the glucose and use it as energy. 
In somebody with diabetes, their body can’t absorb glucose because there is a problem with their insulin. This means: 
- their cells don’t use the glucose for energy 
- the unused glucose stays in their blood and builds up 
- the excess glucose can damage their arteries (arteries carry oxygen-rich blood and nutrients around the body) 
- if their arteries are damaged, it can increase their risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases. "

- Type 1 diabetes - when your body can’t make insulin because your immune system (which usually protects your body from bad bacteria and viruses) destroys the cells that make it. 
- Type 2 diabetes - when your body doesn’t make enough insulin or your body doesn’t use the insulin it makes properly.  
Around 1 in 12 people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a common condition. 
Sometimes, pregnant women can develop diabetes which usually disappears after giving birth. This type of diabetes is called gestational diabetes. "

Scientists understand type 1 diabetes causes the body to attack the cells that make insulin. Research is happening to understand why that is. 
The cause of type 2 diabetes is a problem with the amount of insulin being made or used. The body can’t control its blood sugar levels so they keep rising. It’s often linked to: 
- being physically inactive 
- having excess weight or obesity 
- having a family history of type 2 diabetes 
- having pre-diabetes – when your blood sugar levels are above the normal range but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. 
It usually develops gradually and affects more adults over the age of 40. But it can develop at any age. And if you have a South Asian, African Caribbean or Black Asian background, you might have an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. "

- having breath that smells fruity 
- peeing more than usual, especially during the night 
- having itchy genitals or thrush that keeps coming back

"['how is diabetes treated? ', 'what are the approaches to treating diabetes?', 'how do healthcare professionals manage and address diabetes?', 'what are the therapeutic methods used for diabetes treatment?', 'by what means is diabetes managed and treated?', 'what are the strategies employed in the treatment of diabetes?']","The treatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be slightly different. 
Eating a healthy balanced diet and being physically active are recommended to support the treatment for both types, especially type 2. This is because type 2 diabetes is linked to having excess weight or obesity. But it can also help you sleep better and feel more energised. 
The treatment for type 1 diabetes is insulin injections multiple times a day, regular exercise and a healthy balanced diet. 
People with type 1 diabetes can’t make insulin because their body attacks the cells that make it. This means their body needs to be given insulin to control their blood sugar levels. And they will need to monitor their blood sugar levels multiple times a day. 
There are different types of insulin injections. If you have type 1 diabetes, your doctor will explain the types of insulin you need, how often you need them and how to check your blood sugar levels. 
The treatment for type 2 diabetes is usually medication and a keen focus on regular exercise and a healthy balanced diet. 
Most people need medicine to control their type 2 diabetes. The medicine helps to lower the amount of sugar in your blood. This can reduce the risk of developing other health problems like heart and circulatory diseases. 
Sometimes, people with type 2 diabetes might need insulin injections. And, their doctor might ask them to check their blood sugar levels regularly. But most type 2 diabetics don’t have to. 
The type of medication, the amount you take and if you need insulin injections might change over time. You will have regular check-ups with your doctor to review your treatment plan. 
Some people with type 2 diabetes may be able to stop taking medication if they can control their blood sugar levels with a healthy balanced diet, regular exercise and by losing weight. "

Your doctor will usually advise you to: 
- Eat a range of foods including fruit, vegetables and starchy foods like pasta. 
- Eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day – skipping meals can cause your blood sugar levels to go too low. 
- Reduce the amount of high-sugar, high-fat and high-salt foods and drinks you have.
Being physically active is another great way to control your blood sugar levels. Exercise helps to lower the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood because your muscles need to use more of it. This can reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases and other complications. Physical activity can also boost your mood; help you feel less tired, and it can be fun too. 
Adults in the UK are recommended to get around two and a half hours of exercise a week. As long as you’re doing something to get you out of breath, it can be anything: 
- swimming 
- riding a bike 
- brisk walking with your dog 
- playing with a frisbee in the park 
- pushing a lawn mower or hoovering. 
If you are diabetic, it is important to manage your blood pressure and cholesterol level to reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases. And having a healthy weight is the best way to manage your blood pressure, cholesterol level and diabetes. 
People living with excess weight or obesity and diabetes will usually be advised by their doctor to make small lifestyle changes to have a healthy weight. If you are worried about your weight, you can visit your local GP service for weight loss advice and support. "

When arteries get damaged, it’s easier for fatty material to stick to the artery walls. This can clog the arteries and reduce the space for blood to flow properly. 
If the arteries carrying blood to your heart get clogged, it can lead to a heart attack. 
If the arteries carrying blood to your brain get clogged, it can lead to a stroke.

- eye and sight problems 
- gum disease and teeth problems 
- difficulty getting sexually aroused 
- being more likely to get thrush or urinary tract infections 
- nerve damage which might affect feeling, moving or hearing 
- heart and circulatory diseases like heart attack, stroke and vascular dementia 
- feeling shaky, sweaty, or disorientated from a quick rise or dip in blood sugar levels 
- diabetic ketoacidosis – when the body can’t use sugar for energy it starts to use fat instead, this mostly affects type 1 diabetics.

When it comes to your heart, it can reduce your risk of heart and circulatory diseases by up to 35% - giving you peace of mind and a longer life. Getting active can also help you:
- control your weight
- boost energy and improve sleep
- improve mental health
- improve symptoms of heart and circulatory conditions like angina pain in the long-term – making everyday life easier and letting you do more
- reduce blood pressure and cholesterol, which lowers your risk of getting heart and circulatory diseases like heart attacks, strokes and vascular dementia

"['should i exercise?', 'is it advisable for me to engage in exercise?', 'is exercise recommended in my case?', 'should i consider incorporating exercise into my routine?', 'is it beneficial for me to exercise?', 'would it be wise for me to start exercising?']","It’s normal to worry whether you should exercise if you’ve got a heart problem. Most people will still be able to and feel the benefits of staying active. In most cases, getting your muscles and lungs working better helps put less strain on your heart. However, there are some things to keep in mind before getting active:
- heart conditions – with some conditions, you may have to think about whether you can use weights, or how intense your exercise can be. If you use GTN spray to manage your chest pain, speak to your doctor or pharmacist about how you can use it alongside exercise
- medications – some may affect your exercise. For example, beta blockers affect your heart rate and may make you feel more tired. Talk with your doctor to find the medication that works for you
- implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) & pacemakers – most people with these implanted devices can exercise safely and your doctor should tell you if you have any limits to what you should do. This often means sticking to moderate intensity exercise (like walking and gardening) and avoiding contact sports like rugby
- listen to your body – you should only exercise if you’re feeling well enough to do so. If you start to feel symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations (the feeling like your heart is pounding, or skipping a beat) or unusual shortness of breath, you may need to scale back your exercise. Speak to your doctor If you’re experiencing this
- the weather – if it’s too hot or too cold, your heart may be under more strain to exercise. If this is the case, try a low-stress activity like stretching instead."

The recommended types of exercise for improving heart health are:
- aerobic exercise - when you’re moving your body in a way that makes you warm and slightly out of breath like when walking, cycling, doing housework or gardening. Over time, this type of exercise helps your heart and circulatory system to work better by helping to lower your blood pressure and resting heart rate, improving cholesterol levels and helping you maintain a healthy weight
- balance and flexibility exercise – exercise like yoga, tai chi and Pilates where we hold our bodies in less stable positions. These exercises make sure our muscles don’t get too tight and keep us flexible, helping avoid pain or injury and reduce the risk of having falls
- resistance exercise – resistance training like lifting weights or using resistance bands and cables to strengthen your muscles. The stronger your muscles are, the harder they can work which takes the strain off your heart making it easier to do everyday tasks. Check in with your doctor before you start any resistance training as it may not be suitable for some people with heart conditions.

It’s important to remember that getting active doesn’t have to mean spending lots of time doing an activity that you may not enjoy. It can be something as simple as playing with your grandkids, walking to the shop or gardening. If it gets you a little out of breath, you’re being active.
For most people, your weekly exercise should be a combination of aerobic, resistance and flexibility and balance activities for well-rounded health."

Moderate exercise is when you feel warm and comfortably breathless like when walking or pushing a lawn mower. Intense exercise is when you breathe hard and fast like when running, swimming or cycling.
What one person finds moderate may be intense to another. That’s why it’s helpful to do the ‘talk test’ while you’re exercising to find the right level for you. The talk test:
- if you can comfortably talk while being active
- feel warm and are breathing a little more heavily than normal
- you're moving at the right pace.

Whether it’s walking or weights, it’s important to start low and slow and to ‘listen’ to your body. A session could be as little as five or 10 minutes. Even the smallest changes can have great results.
It’s best to spread your exercise evenly over the week, making sure you have some rest days to ensure your body recovers. Recovery can be just as important for improving your fitness as the exercise itself. Being active is about living a happier, healthier life and should fit into it how you live."

- eating early and right – eat carbohydrate-based foods in plenty of time before exercising for energy and to avoid feeling too full
- getting the essentials together – get your equipment ready, wear light, loose clothing and have a bottle of water and towel to hand
- preparing your space – if you’re at the gym, know what equipment you plan on using and where those things are. If at home, make sure there’s enough room to exercise, move anything in your way and that you won’t be interrupted

- preparing your body by raising your heart rate slowly, so there isn't a sudden increase in workload for your heart
- sending blood to the active areas of your body
- stretching to keep your muscles from shortening and increasing flexibility
- warming up your muscles and preparing the joints for movement.

This means choosing healthy carbohydrates, lean proteins, eating more fruit and vegetables and keeping hydrated.
- carbohydrates - these are your body’s main source of energy when you're exercising. It’s best to choose high fibre, wholegrain varieties of oats, pasta, rice, breads and cereals. Carbohydrates provide the slow release of energy you need to fuel your exercise. There’s no need to eat extra carbohydrates if you’re active unless you’re training for longer events
- fruit and vegetables - these are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fibre which help keep your body and immune system healthy when you exercise. Aim for at least five portions a day
- protein - known as the building blocks of life, these help your body grow and repair. You should try and include a portion of protein like lean meat, fish, eggs, dairy or alternatives sources like peas, pulses or beans with most meals
- fluids - exercising raises your body temperature and your body tries to cool down by sweating. This causes a loss of water and salts through the skin. How much fluid you need depends on how long you exercise for, the temperature, and the amount you sweat. For most people, unless you are exercising for more than an hour, drinking 6-8 glasses of fluid (water, squash, fruit juice, caffeine-free teas) a day is a good idea.

Allow enough time to eat and drink before exercising to ensure your food is fully digested and avoid feeling sick or uncomfortable during exercise. Try to have a balanced meal 2-3 hours before exercising.

You may only notice small improvements, but it all adds up. Here are our top tips to get you started:
- breathe – remember to breathe deeply throughout an activity to keep oxygen coming into your body and to help keep your blood pressure under control
- be sociable - go for a walk with a friend, join a group or get active for charity to meet like-minded people and have fun
- keep an eye on your progress - many smart phones count the number of steps you walk each day or time how long it takes you to swim a lap of the pool. Challenging yourself and getting better at an activity is fun
- make exercise part of your day - plan a time to do some physical activity that fits in with the rest of your day like by walking or cycling instead of driving. It could even be something as small as parking your car further from the shop or getting off the bus a stop early. If you miss a day, don't worry - just make sure you start again when you can
- keep moving - everyday activities count, so look out for opportunities to be active during the day while you're inside or outdoors. Whilst moving, don’t change position too quickly as this can cause dizziness
- start small - try breaking down your exercise into short sessions throughout the day and build up from there. You could start by taking a five minute walk every day or trying our 10-minute workout
- set realistic goals – setting goals like doing a short walk outside every day is fun and makes you feel great when you achieve them. If you want to keep setting new goals, read about using the FITT principle
- set reminders where you can see them – stick post-it notes on the fridge or set daily reminders on your phone so you don’t forget (it’s easily done)
- get variety - make a list of enjoyable activities you can do such as dancing or cycling and do a different activity each week. This way you’re less likely to get bored and lose interest
- be proud of yourself - pat yourself on the back when you hit a goal. You’ve looked after your heart and that’s something to be proud of.

It can happen at any stage of pregnancy, but is more common in the second or third trimester.
It happens when your body cannot produce enough insulin – a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels – to meet your extra needs in pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes can cause problems for you and your baby during pregnancy and after birth. But the risks can be reduced if the condition is detected early and well managed."

Blood sugar levels may be reduced by changing your diet and being more active if you can. Gentle activities such as walking, swimming and prenatal yoga can help reduce blood sugar. But tell your midwife or doctor before starting an activity you haven’t done before.
However, if these changes don't lower your blood sugar levels enough, you will need to take medicine as well. This may be tablets or insulin injections.
You'll also be more closely monitored during your pregnancy and birth to check for any potential problems.
If you have gestational diabetes, it's best to give birth before 41 weeks. Induction of labour or a caesarean section may be recommended if labour does not start naturally by this time.
Earlier delivery may be recommended if there are concerns about your or your baby's health or if your blood sugar levels have not been well controlled.

But women who've had it are more likely to develop:
- gestational diabetes again in future pregnancies
- type 2 diabetes – a lifelong type of diabetes

You should have a blood test to check for diabetes 6 to 13 weeks after giving birth, and once every year after that if the result is normal.
See your GP if you develop symptoms of high blood sugar, such as increased thirst, needing to pee more often than usual, and a dry mouth – do not wait until your next test. 
You should have the tests even if you feel well, as many people with diabetes do not have any symptoms.
You'll also be advised about things you can do to reduce your risk of getting diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly.
Some research has suggested that babies of mothers who had gestational diabetes may be more likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life.

They can include:
- pain or discomfort in your chest that happens suddenly and doesn't go away
- pain that spreads to your left or right arm, or to your neck, jaw, back or stomach. For some people the pain or tightness is severe, while for others it’s uncomfortable. It may feel like heaviness, or a burning pain similar to indigestion
- feeling sick, sweaty, light-headed or short of breath.
Other less common symptoms include:
- a sudden feeling of anxiety that can feel similar to a panic attack
- lots of coughing or wheezing due to a build-up of fluid in the lungs.
It’s possible to have a heart attack without experiencing all these symptoms, and it’s important to remember everyone experiences pain differently. This is more likely in elderly people or people with diabetes, as the condition can cause nerve damage which affects how you feel pain.
Discomfort in the chest can be caused by many things from a heart attack to indigestion and muscle strain. Learn more about the different causes of chest pain."

CHD causes your coronary arteries to become narrowed by a gradual build-up of fatty deposits called atheroma. 
If a piece of atheroma breaks off, a blood clot forms around this to try and repair the damage to the artery wall. This clot can block your coronary artery, causing your heart muscle to be starved of blood and oxygen.
Other less common causes of a heart attack include:
- spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) which is when a tear appears in the wall of one of your coronary arteries
- using harmful drugs like cocaine and amphetamines (speed)
- hypoxia (a sudden drop in oxygen levels in the body).
Although symptoms can vary from person to person, women and men generally experience the same heart attack symptoms. However, research shows women tend to not recognise the symptoms as a sign of a heart attack as quickly. This is mainly because heart attacks are wrongly believed to be a “man’s problem."""

Don’t try and take yourself to hospital, as the ambulance team will give you the best care and do tests on the way.
In the ambulance, the team will do an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical activity of your heart. This is an important test to find out if you're having a heart attack. If the ECG shows you’re having a heart attack, you’ll be taken to a specialist centre to get the best treatment.
Whether or not the ECG confirms a heart attack, you’ll need further tests to find out what’s going on. These tests may include:
- an assessment of your symptoms and medical history
- physical examinations, including measuring your blood pressure and monitoring your heart rhythm and heart rate
- blood tests to see if there’s been any damage to your heart muscle
- more ECGs 
- an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of your heart).

This can reduce the amount of permanent damage to your heart and save your life. 
Many people need to have emergency treatment to restore the blood flow. Emergency treatment may include: 
- Coronary angioplasty - putting one or more stents (which are like small pieces of scaffolding) into the narrowed or blocked artery to keep it open and improve the blood supply to the heart.
- Thrombolysis - involves giving you ""clot-busting"" medicine to dissolve the blood clot that's blocking the coronary artery.
- Coronary bypass surgery - helps to bring back normal blood flow by attaching a blood vessel from your leg, arm or chest in your heart to go around the blocked artery.
You’ll discuss with your doctor about which of these treatments might be best for you."

If you’ve had coronary bypass surgery, it’s likely you'll stay in hospital for at least a week.
During your stay, you’ll be monitored and have tests to see how well your heart is recovering.
When you first arrive in hospital, you’ll likely be admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU) which is for people with serious heart issues who need to be closely watched. During your stay, you might be moved to a cardiac ward.

- ACE inhibitors or ARBs such as ramipril or losartan are prescribed to treat heart failure and high blood pressure.
- Beta blockers like bisoprolol help control your heart rate and can also help lower blood pressure. This helps to reduce the workload of the heart so that it can recover.
- Statins like atorvastatin reduce the level of cholesterol in your blood and protect the insides of your arteries.
- Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray helps reduce chest pain which can happen after a heart attack.

Coronary heart disease is when your coronary arteries (which move blood to the heart) get narrowed or blocked by a build-up of fatty material within their walls.
The build-up of material is a condition called atherosclerosis, which can cause:
- angina – usually a pain or discomfort in your chest when your heart muscle isn’t getting enough blood
- heart attack – when the fatty material breaks down it can become a blood clot which can block your artery and cut off the supply of blood to your heart
- peripheral arterial disease (PAD) – when your arteries become narrow so blood can’t get to your leg muscles, causing pain in your calves, hips, buttocks and thighs – usually when you’re walking or exercising
- stroke - when the blood supply to your brain is blocked. "

The medicine is injected or inhaled as a gas through a mask. A specialist doctor (called an anaesthetist) gives you the medicine before the surgery starts and stays with you to make sure you have enough to keep you asleep.
You’ll then go into the operating room for the surgery which normally lasts three to six hours. Surgeons usually make a cut down the middle of the breastbone (the long flat bone in the middle of the chest) to reach your heart. If you have a vein graft from your leg or an artery graft from your arm, they will make smaller cuts in these places too.
A heart-lung bypass machine will move the blood around your body while the surgeon operates on your heart. Some surgeons may carry out coronary bypass operations without this machine. This is called beating heart surgery.
Your surgeon may do newer bypass surgeries like endoscopic or minimally invasive surgery. These involve making several small cuts and using an endoscope camera to see the blood vessels and heart. Surgeons do this because it can help you get up out of bed sooner and speed up recovery.
If your surgeon needs to cut your breastbone, you’ll have a wound down the middle of your chest. It’s normal to be worried or scared about having scars after surgery but you're not alone. Listen to people who have had heart surgery and how they learned to accept their scars.

This is where people who need special monitoring after surgery go so a close eye can be kept on them.
When your doctor decides that you don’t need intensive care anymore, you’ll be moved to the cardiac ward or the high dependency unit which is for people who need a higher level of care than normal.
After that, you can begin your recovery. You should generally be able to sit in a chair after one day, walk after three days and use stairs after five or six days. When you go home, you’ll need to relax for a few weeks.
You should be able to do most of your normal activities after about six weeks, including working, driving and sex. If you have a heavy manual job, you may need to rest for longer.
In many hospitals, after a heart bypass operation, a member of the cardiac specialist team will see you on the ward to give you information about your condition and the treatment you’ve had.
They’ll talk to you about making lifestyle changes and how to reduce your risk factors (the things that increase your risk of heart disease) to help protect your heart in the future. They’ll offer you cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) to get you fit and strong again too.
It’s okay to feel low after surgery and the team can help you if you want to talk with them. Many people say their time in hospital becomes a blur. You may find it helpful to write down or have someone with you to help remember the information you get throughout your journey.
It's important to look after your heart health long term so you don’t develop more heart problems. You can do this by making lifestyle changes such as:
- avoiding or drinking less alcohol (no more than the recommended limit of 14 units a week)
- eating healthier foods
- not smoking or using tobacco products
- staying active.

Heart bypass surgery may not be an option if the arteries around your heart are too narrow or blocked. Instead, your doctor may want to do a coronary angioplasty and stent insertion operation.
A coronary angioplasty is where a special kind of balloon is gently blown up inside the coronary artery to open it up. A stainless steel mesh called a stent is put in the artery to keep it open and let blood flow normally again. The balloon will be taken out.
Before deciding to do an angioplasty, you’ll have an angiogram (type of x-ray) that shows how blocked your arteries are. Your doctor will then know what the best treatment is for you. Before and after your surgery, you may need to take medications to support your heart. In some cases, coronary heart disease can be treated with different medications like:
- antiplatelets – which help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke
- beta blockers – which help reduce the risk of heart conditions like angina and heart attack
- statins - which lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of angina, heart attack and stroke.

Your arteries are the vessels (tubes) that carry blood from your heart to your brain and the rest of your body. You need a certain amount of pressure to get the blood moving around your body.
Your blood pressure naturally goes up and down throughout the day and night, and it’s normal for it to go up while you’re moving about. It’s when your overall blood pressure is always high, even when you are resting, that you need to do something about it.
Blood pressure is measured using two numbers:
- Systolic pressure: this is the higher of the two numbers. It’s the pressure against your arteries when your heart is pumping blood around your body.
- Diastolic pressure: this is the lower of the two numbers. It shows how much pressure is in your arteries when your heart relaxes between beats."

Your arteries are normally stretchy, so they can cope with your blood pressure going up and down. But with high blood pressure, your arteries lose their stretchiness, becoming stiff or narrow.
This narrowing makes it easier for fatty material (atheroma) to build up. This narrowing and damage to the arteries lining your heart or brain could trigger a life-threatening heart attack or stroke.

- are someone who smokes
- drink too much alcohol
- eat too much salt and not enough fruit and vegetables
- don't get enough exercise
- are overweight, especially around your mid-section.
People living in deprived areas are also at higher risk of having high blood pressure, as well as people who are of black African or black Caribbean descent. Changes in your diet and increasing activity levels will help improve your blood pressure.

If your blood pressure is well controlled, you’ll normally be monitored yearly, along with reviewing any medication you take. When you start new medications or have dose changes to existing ones, your blood pressure will need to be checked more than once a year.
Check with your healthcare team how often to measure your blood pressure at home if you have your own monitor. Try keeping a diary of your readings – this will help your healthcare team spot patterns, and it might be motivating to see how your blood pressure improve over time.

"['what is high cholesterol?', 'how would you define high cholesterol?', 'can you explain the concept of high cholesterol?', 'what characterizes high cholesterol levels?', 'what is the meaning of high cholesterol?', 'how do you describe high cholesterol?']","Cholesterol is a natural fatty substance in your blood. It’s produced in the liver and it is also in some of the foods we eat. Cholesterol is important to keep the cells in our bodies healthy.
High cholesterol means that you have too much cholesterol in your blood. There are many things that can cause this. If you don’t take steps to lower high cholesterol, it can increase your risk of heart attack and stroke. "
"['what causes high cholesterol?', 'what factors contribute to elevated cholesterol levels?', 'what leads to high cholesterol?', 'what are the underlying causes of elevated cholesterol?', 'why does cholesterol levels increase?', 'what are the reasons behind high cholesterol?']","Anyone can develop high cholesterol. It can be caused by many different things; some you can control, and others you can’t.
Things that cause high cholesterol which you can control:
Your lifestyle:
- eating too much saturated fat – this reduces the liver’s ability to remove cholesterol, so it builds up in the blood
- being physically inactive – being active raises the level of ‘good’ cholesterol and reduces the level of ‘bad’ cholesterol
- smoking - this can lead to high cholesterol levels and it causes tar to build up in your arteries, making it easier for cholesterol to stick to your artery walls.

Things that cause high cholesterol which you can't control:
- Your age, biological sex and ethnic background:
- getting older – having higher cholesterol is more likely as we age
- if your biological sex is male (you were assigned male at birth) – males are more likely to have high cholesterol
- your ethnic background – if you are from a south Asian background, you are more likely to have high cholesterol.

Your genes:
Genes carry the information that determines your features or characteristics that are passed on to you — or inherited — from your parents. Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), is an inherited condition, meaning you were born with it. It is often passed down through families in faulty genes and can lead to very high levels of cholesterol, even if you don’t have other risk factors.

Your general health:
- kidney disease - when your kidneys aren’t working well, it also changes the way your body handles cholesterol, which can lead to high cholesterol
- liver disease – an important job of the liver is to both produce cholesterol and clear it from the body, but if the liver isn’t working well it struggles to do this, increasing your risk of high cholesterol
- if you live with excess weight, especially around your middle
- if you have type 2 diabetes, you are at greater risk of having high cholesterol
- having an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism – when your body doesn’t make enough thyroid hormone)
- growth hormone deficiency (when not enough of the growth hormone is made). "

It is carried around your body to the cells that need it by proteins in your blood. Proteins are substances in your body that do most of the work in your cells and help keep your body’s tissues and organs working as they should.
When cholesterol and proteins combine, they're called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoproteins. One is good for your health; the other is bad.
High-density lipoproteins or HDL is known as ‘good’ cholesterol. It gets rid of the ‘bad’ cholesterol from your blood by taking cholesterol you don’t need back to the liver, where it is broken down and removed from your body.
Non-high-density lipoproteins or non-HDL is known as 'bad' cholesterol. Too much non-HDL leads to a build up of fatty deposits inside the walls of the blood vessels (channels that carry blood throughout your body). This builds up and narrows blood vessels, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke. 
You may also have heard 'bad' cholesterol being called 'LDL' cholesterol. This used to be the main measure of harmful types of cholesterol, but we now know that other forms of non-HDL cholesterol can also affect your health."
"['what are triglycerides?', 'can you explain the concept of triglycerides?', 'how would you define triglycerides?', 'what characterizes triglycerides?', 'what is the meaning of triglycerides?', 'how do you describe triglycerides?']","Our blood also contains a type of fat called triglycerides (found in fat cells), which can also contribute to narrowed arteries. Having excess weight, eating a lot of fatty and sugary foods or drinking too much alcohol can cause high triglyceride levels.
If you have had results from a lipid profile (a test that looks at all aspects of your cholesterol), you may see your triglycerides level – your doctor will be able to tell you if it's too high.
You can have a normal level of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol but still have a high triglyceride level. If you are found to have this, you may wish to speak to your GP to discuss what it means for you."

But if left untreated, it can lead to heart attack and stroke.
It's often a hidden risk factor which means it can happen without us knowing until it's too late. That is why it's so important to get your cholesterol level checked.
However, if you have familial hypercholesterolaemia, you may have visible signs of high cholesterol. These include:
- Tendon xanthomata - swellings made from cholesterol on the knuckles of your hands, your knees or the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle.
- Xanthelasmas - small, yellow lumps of cholesterol near the inner corner of your eye.
- Corneal arcus - this is a pale white ring around the coloured part of your eye, your iris."

It is sometimes referred to as a ‘lipid profile’. Your GP or practice nurse will take a blood sample, to check for the following:
- evels of good cholesterol (HDL)
- evels of bad cholesterol (non-HDL)
- riglycerides.
You will also get a total cholesterol result. 
You may be offered a finger-prick cholesterol test. This can be done in some pharmacies, or as part of the NHS Health Check in England.
Cholesterol levels vary from person to person, but in general, for a healthy heart you need a low level of non-HDL level and a higher level of HDL."

What matters is your individual risk, which a doctor can help you determine based on your results.
Total cholesterol: 5 or below (mmol/L)
HDL (good cholesterol): 1 or above (mmol/L)
Non-HDL (bad cholesterol): 4 or below (mmol/L)
Fasting triglycerides (when you're asked not to eat for several hours before the test): 1.7 or below (mmol/L)
Non-fasting triglycerides (when you eat as normal before the test): 2.3 or below (mmol/L)
Total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio: 6 or below (mmol/L)

If you have been told you have a high cholesterol level, it means you have too much 'bad' cholesterol in your blood, which increases your risk a heart attack or stroke. But a high level of 'good' (HDL) cholesterol can help keep that 'bad' (non-HDL) cholesterol in check."

- You can try ways of getting more active, which will help lower your cholesterol but also help you sleep better and feel more energetic
- You can cut down on alcohol and stop smoking
- You can enjoy trying healthy foods and recipes that are good for your heart.

If lifestyle changes are not enough to lower your high cholesterol, your doctor may suggest medication. If you are diagnosed with high cholesterol, your GP should invite you for a blood test every year to check your levels and adjust your treatment if necessary.
Statins are the main type of medicine used to reduce cholesterol. But there are other treatments available. Your doctor will let you know if you need to take any other drugs which help control your cholesterol levels. They may also refer you to a specialist called a lipidologist.

The right side of your heart receives the de-oxygenated blood that has just travelled round your body. It pumps the blood to your lungs to collect a fresh supply of oxygen. The left side of your heart pumps the re-oxygenated blood round your body again.

Your heart muscle is made up of three layers of tissue:
- Pericardium : a thin, outer lining that protects and surrounds your heart.
- Myocardium : a thick, muscular middle layer that contracts and relaxes to pump blood around of your heart.
- Endocardium : a thin, inner layer that makes up the lining of the four chambers and the valves in your heart."

- helps control your blood pressure and keep it within healthy levels
- raises your levels of good cholesterol, and reduces the bad cholesterol
- can help to control your blood glucose levels, reducing your risk of Type 2 diabetes
- increases the number of calories you burn and helps you maintain a healthy weight.

Any activity is better than none, and you should try to break up long periods of inactivity like sitting or lying down. When you’re watching TV, get up and walk around during the ad breaks.
Aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week. This is anything that raises your heart rate, and makes you breathe faster and feel warmer, like brisk walking or cycling. You can spread out the 150 minutes over the week. You can even do short bursts of activity – every minute counts. You should also aim to do muscle strengthening activities like using hand weights, climbing the stairs, gardening such as digging, or carrying heavy shopping on at least two days a week.

- Plan how you will deal with your cravings when you’re at events and times where you would usually smoke.
- If you usually smoke after meals, eat foods that can make cigarettes taste bad like cheese, fruit and vegetables. Or change your routine to keep your mind busy when you would usually smoke, like washing the dishes straight after eating.
- Cravings usually last around 5 minutes. Plan things you can do in 5 minutes to stay busy for when you get cravings.
- When you’re out, hold your drink with the hand that used to hold cigarettes and use a straw. This will help to keep your hands and mouth busy.
- When you get a craving, remind yourself of why you’re quitting. You may want to carry a picture of your family with you to look at if you’re tempted to smoke.

- Time – it's time to call 18 immediately if you see any of these symptoms.
It’s called F.A.S.T because timing is critical if you're having a stroke. You could lose millions of nerve cells for every minute without treatment.

- don't smoke
- cut down on alcohol
- control high blood pressure 
- control high cholesterol
- control blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes).

Your rehabilitation will begin in hospital where specialists, such as nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists will discuss what help you’ll need. The aim of rehabilitation is to help return you as close as possible to how you were before the stroke. They also support you to live as independently as you can.
If you’ve had a stroke, you may be at risk of developing vascular dementia. This happens when a stroke damages part of your brain, leading to symptoms such as concentration problems and personality changes. If you have any concerns you should speak to your GP.

More common symptoms include extreme tiredness, poor feeding, excessive sweating, rapid heartbeat, breathing problems, chest pain and a blue tinge to the skin. If you notice any of these symptoms in your child, you should seek medical attention.

If a congenital heart condition is suspected after your 20-week pregnancy scan:
- You may be asked to attend another scan with a specialist or referred to a fetal medicine unit, obstetrician or a specialist in cardiac or child medicine.
- If a congenital heart condition is confirmed, you should be given a detailed description of the problem, information about any surgery that might be needed, and the overall long-term outlook.
- If appropriate, specialist monitoring and care will be provided before, during and after the birth so that your baby can receive tests and treatment as soon as possible.  Some heart conditions can now also be treated in-utero (in the womb) before the birth.

If a congenital heart condition is suspected in a baby or child:
Your child may undergo a physical examination and heart tests such as an ECG.

It mostly affects people who are over the age of 65.
Vascular dementia is a condition caused by poor blood flow in the brain, resulting in symptoms like memory loss, confusion, and thinking difficulties. There’s no cure, but treatment may slow its progression.
Vascular dementia is a specific type of dementia. It is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease.
Like other types of dementia, vascular dementia doesn't have any known cure. Although it's sometimes possible to slow down the development of symptoms, unfortunately they will get worse as the brain loses more and more of it functioning."

This stops the surrounding brain cells from working properly, causing them to die over time.
The causes of a reduced blood supply to your brain include:
- small vessel disease – narrowing of small blood vessels deep inside your brain, often as a result of atherosclerosis (a build-up of fatty material inside your arteries)
- a stroke – where the blood supply to part of your brain is suddenly cut off, due to a blood clot or haemorrhage (a bleed)
- mini-strokes – known as transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs). These can cause tiny but widespread damage over time."

Your early symptoms will depend on which part of your brain has been affected. This means different people can experience different symptoms.
Vascular dementia can affect people of all ages, although it's often associated with growing older. If you're under 65 years old, it's known as 'young onset' or 'early onset' vascular dementia.
Early signs of vascular dementia include:
- concentration problems, such as struggling to focus during a conversation
- mood and personality changes, such as irritability or feeling low
- poor short-term memory
- difficulty with everyday skills, such as reading or driving
- difficulty with decision making and planning
- slowing down of thought processes
- difficulty saying your thoughts clearly.

In the later stages, you may experience symptoms such as:

- carry out physical examinations, mental ability tests and other routine tests to help them rule out other physical or mental health causes.

Consider taking a loved one to you to the appointment, not only for support, but also to help the GP get a complete picture of how things have been for you.
If you can’t take a loved one, your GP may want to reach out to them on the phone so they can better understand your daily routine and skills. This will only happen with your permission.
If your GP suspects vascular dementia, they will refer you to a specialist or memory clinic. You may then have a CT or MRI scan of your brain to check for any abnormalities.

However, there’s lots of help and support to help you to continue to live well.

With Medication:
You might be given medication to control high blood pressure or high cholesterol. This may have contributed to your condition and controlling it can help slow down the progression.
If you have vascular dementia, medication given for Alzheimer’s disease isn’t recommended. However, you could be given this medication if you have a mixed diagnosis of vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

With Lifestyle changes:
Research has shown that improving your lifestyle can help slow down the progression of vascular dementia. There are some small changes you can make that might reduce the chance of more damage to the blood vessels in your brain:
- eat healthily
- be physically active
- keep to a healthy weight and lose weight if necessary
- don't smoke
- cut down on alcohol
- control high blood pressure
- control cholesterol levels
- control blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes).

With Support programmes:
Your healthcare team may also suggest a range of social activities to improve your wellbeing and slow down the progression as much as possible. Some examples could be:
- group cognitive (this means the process of thinking, reasoning, or remembering) stimulation therapy – taking part in group activities and discussions to help with memory and connecting with others
- group reminiscence therapy - sharing life experiences, memories and stories from the past to help improve your wellbeing
- cognitive rehabilitation or occupational therapy – getting support in carrying out everyday tasks independently for as long as possible."

However, it's understandable if you feel overwhelmed and worried about how to cope.
On a practical level, there are many things you can do to support yourself, or someone diagnosed with vascular dementia. Some examples include:
- break complex tasks down into small steps
- use reminders, pill boxes or automatic medication dispensers so you don’t forget to take medications
- be aware of the things that make your symptoms worse, like noisy places
- keep to a regular routine and be sure to include activities you enjoy.

Vascular dementia is a progressive condition (this means it gets worse over time), so it’s likely you’ll need further support at some point. People involved in your ongoing care might include:
- healthcare professionals – your GP, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, or a specialist dementia nurse (such as an Admiral Nurse)
- social services – you and your loved ones or carer might be able to access support by having an assessment of your needs
- charities like Dementia UK can offer information, emotional support or advocacy services
- private care and support services, such as paid care workers or your council. Other local organisations may provide meals delivered to your home, if you are eligible.
