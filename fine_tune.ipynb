Before we can instantiate our `Trainer` we need to download our GPT-2 model and create a [TrainingArguments](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments) to access all the points of customization during training. In the `TrainingArguments`, we can define the Hyperparameters we are going to use in the training process like our `learning_rate`, `num_train_epochs`, or  `per_device_train_batch_size`.

            "['### Question:\\nWhat happens during an angiogram?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nThe test is done in a cardiac catheter laboratory or ‘cath lab’. You can expect the test to last around half an hour, although it can sometimes take longer. You will need to lie flat for the procedure.\\n- You will be asked not to eat or drink anything for a few hours before your procedure.\\n- You’ll be given a local anaesthetic injection in the wrist or groin. The catheter (a thin, flexible tube) will then be passed into an artery.\\n- The catheter will be directed through your blood vessels and up to your heart. The doctors will use X-ray to help guide them to the arteries.\\n- A special dye called contrast will then be passed through the catheter and a series of images will be taken. It is very common to feel a hot, flushing sensation as the dye enters your bloodstream, but this is completely normal and only lasts for a few seconds. The dye will show up any narrowed areas or blockages in the artery on the X-ray.\\n- During your procedure, you’ll be attached to a heart monitor that records your heart rate and rhythm and you’ll have a probe measuring your oxygen levels on your finger. If you feel unwell or uncomfortable at any time, you should tell a member of the hospital staff.', '### Question:\\nIs shisha dangerous for my health?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nShisha is not safer than smoking cigarettes. A specially prepared tobacco is heated to produce smoke. The smoke bubbles through a bowl of water and into a long hose-like pipe to be breathed in. Like cigarettes, shisha tobacco can contain:\\n- nicotine\\n- tar\\n- carbon monoxide\\n- heavy metals such as arsenic and lead.\\nEven if you use tobacco-free shisha, the smoke still produces harmful levels of toxins. This can be either just as bad for you or even more harmful than smoke from tobacco-based shisha.\\nIn a shisha session (which usually lasts 20-80 minutes), a shisha smoker can inhale the same amount of smoke as a cigarette smoker consuming over 100 cigarettes.', '### Question:\\nHeart stent recovery: what happens after angioplasty?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nMost people can go home the same day or the next day, but if you’ve had an emergency angioplasty after a heart attack it’s likely you’ll need to stay in hospital for longer.\\nWhen you get home, check the area where the catheter tube was put in. Expect to have some bruising and tenderness, but you should contact your doctor if:\\n- you get any pain, redness or swelling\\n- or if the bruising worsens\\n- or if you develop a temperature\\n\\nBefore you leave hospital, someone will have a chat with you about your recovery and what you can and can’t do. It’s normal to feel tired afterwards but most people find that they’re back to normal after a few days. However, if you’ve also had a\\u202fheart attack, it will take longer to recover.\\nIf you’ve had a stent fitted, you’ll be given medicines to help reduce the risk of blood clots forming in and around the stent. They may include:\\n- aspirin\\n- anti-platelet medication such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel\\nYou may also be asked to take cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins.\\nIf you’ve had an emergency angioplasty, you may be invited to go on a cardiac rehab programme, a course of exercise and information sessions that help you to recover as quickly as possible.\\nIt can feel worrying to have a stent fitted, especially if you’ve had an emergency angioplasty. But many people find recovering from angioplasty is a positive moment to make healthy lifestyle changes that will improve your health and everyday life.', '### Question:\\nHow can I test for an inherited heart condition ?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nIt can be hard to diagnose an inherited heart condition. Your doctor or specialist might think you have one if:\\n- a member of your family has an inherited heart condition \\n- there’s a history of cardiac arrests or premature deaths in your family\\n- a death in the family is hard to explain or thought to be caused by a faulty gene\\n- you’ve been diagnosed with angina or had a heart attack at a young age, in which case your doctor may suspect you have FH.\\nIf someone in your family has been diagnosed with an inherited heart condition, your doctor may suggest that you have tests such as an ECG or echocardiogram.', \"### Question:\\nWhat treatment is available?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nThe treatments for congenital heart conditions depend on the type and severity of the condition. For many babies diagnosed with congenital heart disease, their condition is a minor problem which doesn't need any treatment. Others may need to have some form of treatment, usually either medication or heart surgery. There are also other new techniques and procedures that, in some cases, can be done instead of surgery.\", '### Question:\\nIs Smokeless tobacco harmful for my health?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nSmokeless tobacco is not safer than smoking cigarettes. It’s a type of tobacco that can either be chewed, sucked, or inhaled without producing smoke.\\nMost smokeless tobaccos have the same amount of nicotine as cigarettes. They can also have more than 25 chemicals that are known to cause cancer. Using smokeless tobacco can also increase your risk of having:\\n- complicated pregnancies\\n- mouth and tooth problems\\n- heart and circulatory diseases.', '### Question:\\nWhat is the function of the human heart?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nEach day, your heart beats around 100,000 times. This continuously pumps about five litres (eight pints) of blood around your body through a network of blood vessels called your circulatory system. This blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to all parts of your body to help your organs and muscles work properly. Your blood also carries away unwanted carbon dioxide and waste products.', \"### Question:\\n What are the types?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nCholesterol is used by all the cells in your body to keep them healthy. It is carried around your body to the cells that need it by proteins in your blood. Proteins are substances in your body that do most of the work in your cells and help keep your body’s tissues and organs working as they should.\\nWhen cholesterol and proteins combine, they're called lipoproteins.\\u202fThere are two main types of lipoproteins. One is good for your health; the other is bad.\\nHigh-density lipoproteins\\u202for HDL\\u202fis known as\\u202f‘good’ cholesterol. It gets rid of the ‘bad’ cholesterol from your blood by taking cholesterol you don’t need back to the liver, where it is broken down and removed from your body.\\nNon-high-density lipoproteins\\u202for non-HDL\\u202fis known as 'bad' cholesterol. Too much non-HDL leads to a build up of fatty deposits inside the walls of the blood vessels (channels that carry blood throughout your body). This builds up and narrows blood vessels, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke.\\u202f\\nYou may also have heard 'bad' cholesterol being called 'LDL' cholesterol. This used to be the main measure of harmful types of cholesterol, but we now know that other forms of non-HDL cholesterol can also affect your health.\", \"### Question:\\nWhat is Microvascular angina?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nMicrovascular angina (also known as cardiac syndrome X) usually happens when you're under physical pressure, like when you're exercising, or you’ve been stressed or anxious. The pain is often caused by spasms in the smallest coronary arteries restricting blood flow.  \", '### Question:\\nWhat are the risks of coronary angioplasty and stents?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nAll types of medical procedures come with risk. With angioplasty and stenting, common complications can include:\\n- bleeding, bruising, or an infection where the catheter tube is put into the body (in the wrist or groin)\\n- blood clots – these can form within stents even after the procedure, so it’s important to take any prescribed medicine such as aspirin and anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel\\n\\nThe risk of major complications during an angioplasty is usually less than one percent. Rare risks of angioplasty and stenting include:\\n- complications after or during the procedure, such as a heart attack or stroke\\n- an allergic reaction to the contrast dye used during the procedure\\n- very rarely damage to the coronary artery during the procedure\\nIf you’re worried or have more questions, we encourage you to ask your doctor.

The medicine is injected or inhaled as a gas through a mask. A specialist doctor (called an anaesthetist) gives you the medicine before the surgery starts and stays with you to make sure you have enough to keep you asleep.\\nYou’ll then go into the operating room for the surgery which normally lasts three to six hours. Surgeons usually make a cut down the middle of the breastbone (the long flat bone in the middle of the chest) to reach your heart. If you have a vein graft from your leg or an artery graft from your arm, they will make smaller cuts in these places too.\\nA heart-lung bypass machine will move the blood around your body while the surgeon operates on your heart. Some surgeons may carry out coronary bypass operations without this machine. This is called beating heart surgery.\\nYour surgeon may do newer bypass surgeries like endoscopic or minimally invasive surgery. These involve making several small cuts and using an endoscope camera to see the blood vessels and heart. Surgeons do this because it can help you get up out of bed sooner and speed up recovery.\\nIf your surgeon needs to cut your breastbone, you’ll have a wound down the middle of your chest. It’s normal to be worried or scared about having scars after surgery but you're not alone.

You’ll be given local anaesthetic at the start of the procedure. A narrow flexible tube (called a catheter) is put into your wrist or groin (the area of your hip between your stomach and thigh) and pushed up to the coronary artery. A small balloon at the end of the tube is blown up to widen the narrowed part of your artery.\\nSometimes if the artery is so narrow that the balloon can’t pass through it, a tiny drill might also be used (this is called rotablation) to chip away at the fatty deposits, to gradually widen the narrowing.\\nMost of the time angioplasty is combined with putting in a small metal mesh tube (called a stent). When the balloon is deflated and the catheter tube and balloon are removed, the stent stays in place, acting like a scaffold to keep your artery open.\\nYou may hear your doctor call coronary angioplasty with stenting a PCI. PCI is a medical abbreviation (name) for percutaneous coronary intervention.', '### Question:\\nHow long should you rest after a stent placement?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nIf you’ve had a planned stent placement, it’s best to avoid doing any demanding activities, such as heavy lifting, for a week or so afterwards.\\nYou may need longer if you’ve had an emergency angioplasty or a heart attack – chat with your doctor to find out what’s right for you.', '### Question:\\nAre angina symptoms the same for men and women?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nBoth men and women can experience the same symptoms of angina.

It can be caused by many different things; some you can control, and others you can’t.\\nThings that cause high cholesterol which you can control:\\nYour lifestyle:\\n- eating too much\\u202fsaturated fat – this reduces the liver’s ability to remove cholesterol, so it builds up in the blood\\n- being physically inactive – being active raises the level of ‘good’ cholesterol and reduces the level of ‘bad’ cholesterol\\n- smoking\\u202f- this can lead to high cholesterol levels and it causes tar to build up in your arteries, making it easier for cholesterol to stick to your artery walls.\\n\\nThings that cause high cholesterol which you can't control:\\n- Your age, biological sex and ethnic background:\\n- getting older – having higher cholesterol is more likely as we age\\n- if your biological sex is male (you were assigned male at birth) – males are more likely to have high cholesterol\\n- your ethnic background – if you are from a south Asian background, you are more likely to have high cholesterol.\\n\\nYour genes:\\nGenes carry the information that determines your features or characteristics that are passed on to you — or inherited — from your parents. Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), is an inherited condition, meaning you were born with it. It is often passed down through families in faulty genes and can lead to very high levels of cholesterol, even if you don’t have other risk factors.\\n\\nYour general health:\\n- kidney disease - when your kidneys aren’t working well, it also changes the way your body handles cholesterol, which can lead to high cholesterol\\n- liver disease – an important job of the liver is to both produce cholesterol and clear it from the body, but if the liver isn’t working well it struggles to do this, increasing your risk of high cholesterol\\n- if you live with excess weight, especially around your middle\\n- if you have type 2\\u202fdiabetes, you are at greater risk of having high cholesterol\\n- having an\\u202funderactive thyroid\\u202f(hypothyroidism – when your body doesn’t make enough thyroid hormone)\\n- growth hormone deficiency (when not enough of the growth hormone is made).\\u202f\", '### Question:\\nWhat are the benefits of quitting smoking?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nYou might notice benefits sooner than you think:\\n- your heart rate and blood pressure will begin to return to normal after 20 minutes\\n- your sense of smell and taste will begin to improve after 2-3 days\\n- your breathing will begin to improve, and exercise may be easier after 2-12 weeks\\n- your risk of a heart attack is half that of a smoker after 1 year.\\n\\nQuitting smoking also has other benefits like:\\n- you will have fresher breath and whiter teeth\\n- your skin might look younger and age less quickly\\n- you might have more energy, feel less tired and get less headaches\\n- your immune system will find it easier to fight off colds and flu\\n- your sex drive may increase, and it can improve your fertility\\n- you will protect the health of your children, family and friends.\\n\\nIt’s never too late to benefit from stopping smoking.

Serious complications are rare and your doctor will discuss these before you have it done.\\nFollowing an angiogram, some people may develop a collection of blood under the skin, which is called a haematoma. This can be uncomfortable and cause bruising, but it should go down after a few days. However, contact your doctor if you have any concerns.\\nA small amount of radiation is used during an angiogram. The doctor will bear this in mind if you have been exposed to higher levels than normal.\\n', '### Question:\\nIs angina hereditary?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nNo, angina is not an inherited condition. It won’t be found in a genetic test. But if your grandparents, parents, siblings or children have angina then you have what’s called a strong family history of the condition. This can increase your chance of developing a heart condition that could cause angina too. Find out more about family histories of heart conditions and how you can reduce your risk.', '### Question:\\nHow does blood flow around the heart and the body?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nYour heart is linked to the rest of the circulatory system with blood vessels called arteries and veins.\\n\\n- your arteries deliver oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other areas of your body\\n- your veins return the de-oxygenated blood from your organs back to your heart\\n- your arteries and veins are connected by even smaller blood vessels called capillaries.\\nYour blood flows around your heart and the rest of your body in one direction, like a one-way traffic system. Your heart valves control the direction of your blood flow, they act like doors that open and close with every heartbeat. There are four valves in your heart, they are:\\n\\nthe tricuspid valve and the pulmonary valve on the right side of the heart\\nthe mitral valve and the aortic valve on the left side of your heart.\\nLike the rest of your body, your heart needs to be supplied with oxygen-rich blood to work properly too. The coronary arteries are the arteries responsible for supplying the heart with oxygenated blood. The coronary arteries are spread across the outside of the heart to deliver the blood.', '### Question:\\nHow to prepare for angioplasty and stents?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nIf your doctor recommends having an angioplasty and stents, ask them any questions you may have about it. You can then begin to prepare for the procedure, which can help reduce any stress and anxiety you may feel. Preparation may include:\\n- arranging for someone to look after you during recovery\\n- organising transport to and from the hospital\\n- organising time off from work\\n- continuing to take medication\\n- eating healthy foods (use our\\u202frecipe finder\\u202ffor tasty and heart-healthy ideas)\\n- managing your weight\\n- looking after your mental health\\n- staying active\\nBeing as prepared as possible before surgery can help speed up the time it takes to recover. It can also help you feel less worried.', '### Question:\\nWhat is diabetes?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nDiabetes is a life-long condition that causes your blood sugar levels to become too high. \\nSugar in the blood is also known as glucose, it’s your body’s main source of energy. It comes from the food you eat, particularly carbohydrates like bread and potatoes. \\nGlucose is carried through the bloodstream to cells around the body to give them energy to work. When there’s glucose in the bloodstream, the pancreas (an organ near the stomach) makes a hormone (a chemical messenger) called insulin. Insulin tells the body’s cells to absorb the glucose and use it as energy. \\nIn somebody with diabetes, their body can’t absorb glucose because there is a problem with their insulin. This means: \\n- their cells don’t use the glucose for energy \\n- the unused glucose stays in their blood and builds up \\n- the excess glucose can damage their arteries (arteries carry oxygen-rich blood and nutrients around the body) \\n- if their arteries are damaged, it can increase their risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases. ', '### Question:\\nWhat is the structure of the human heart?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nYour heart has a left side and a right side, they are separated by a thin muscular wall called the Septum. Both sides of your heart have an upper chamber and a lower chamber.\\n\\n- the upper chambers are called the left atrium and the right atrium (or the atria)\\n- the lower chambers are called the left ventricle and the right ventricle.\\n\\nThe right side of your heart receives the de-oxygenated blood that has just travelled round your body. It pumps the blood to your lungs to collect a fresh supply of oxygen. The left side of your heart pumps the re-oxygenated blood round your body again.\\n\\nYour heart muscle is made up of three layers of tissue:\\n- Pericardium : a thin, outer lining that protects and surrounds your heart.\\n- Myocardium : a thick, muscular middle layer that contracts and relaxes to pump blood around of your heart.\\n- Endocardium : a thin, inner layer that makes up the lining of the four chambers and the valves in your heart.', '### Question:\\nWhat causes an inherited heart condition? \\n\\n### Answer:\\nYour body is made up of trillions of cells. Each cell has a nucleus, containing information that makes you unique. This information is called your genes. We all have between 20,000 and 25,000 different genes each.\\nGenes affect how we look and how our bodies work, and we inherit them from our parents. Inherited heart conditions are caused by a fault (or mutation) in one or more of our genes. If one of your parents has a faulty gene, there’s a 50:50 chance you could have it too. If you do, then there’s also a 50:50 chance you could pass it on to your children.\\nIt’s possible to have a faulty gene that can lead to a heart condition, but you may never develop any signs or symptoms of the condition itself. If this happens, you can still pass the faulty gene onto your child and there’s no way of knowing how it may affect them.', \"### Question:\\nWhat causes your heart and circulatory system to go wrong?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nProblems with your heart and circulatory system, including heart attack or a stroke, are usually caused by a gradual build-up of fatty material (called atheroma) in the arteries around the heart and in the arteries that supply blood to your brain.Blocked artery\\nThe fatty material lines the walls of heart's coronary arteries making the space for blood to flow narrower. When the arteries become narrowed and the blood flow is restricted, the arteries can't deliver enough blood to the heart and the brain, which can cause heart and circulatory diseases.\", \"### Question:\\nWhat increases my chance of having a stroke?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nA risk factor increases your chance of developing a condition. Risk factors for a stroke are similar to those for heart diseases, such as angina or heart attacks. \\nThere are many things you can do to help lower your chances of a stroke: \\n- eat healthily \\n- be physically active \\n- keep to a healthy weight and lose weight if necessary\\n- don't smoke\\n- cut down on alcohol\\n- control high blood pressure \\n- control high cholesterol\\n- control blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes).\\nIf you have an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF) your risk of stroke is increased. This is because AF increases the risk of a blood clot forming inside the top chambers of your heart. If this happens, it can travel to your brain and block the blood flow to your brain. \", \"### Question:\\nWhat are Triglycerides?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nOur blood also contains a type of fat called triglycerides (found in fat cells), which can also contribute to narrowed arteries. Having excess weight, eating a lot of fatty and sugary foods or drinking too much alcohol can cause high triglyceride levels.\\nIf you have had results from a lipid profile (a test that looks at all aspects of your cholesterol), you may see your triglycerides level – your doctor will be able to tell you if it's too high.\\nYou can have a normal level of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol but still have a high triglyceride level. If you are found to have this, you may wish to speak to your GP to discuss what it means for you.\", '### Question:\\nHow does physical inactivity increase the risk of heart and circulatory diseases?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nBeing inactive can lead to fatty material building up in your arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood to your organs). If the arteries that carry blood to your heart get damaged and clogged, it can lead to a heart attack. If this happens in the arteries that carry blood to your brain it can lead to a stroke. The good news is there are many ways to reduce the risk of this happening.', '### Question:\\nAre there Treatment for an inherited heart condition ?\\n\\n### Answer:\\nDifferent inherited heart conditions require different treatments and your doctor or specialist will explain what’s right for your condition.\\nTreatment for an IHC includes:\\n- changes to your lifestyle\\n- medication \\n- implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs).\\n']\n"
