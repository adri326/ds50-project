What is vascular dementia?
Dementia is a word used to describe a set of mental (the mind) and neurological (the brain) symptoms which worsen over time, such as memory loss and difficulty concentrating. It mostly affects people who are over the age of 65.
Vascular dementia is a condition caused by poor blood flow in the brain, resulting in symptoms like memory loss, confusion, and thinking difficulties. There’s no cure, but treatment may slow its progression.
Vascular dementia is a specific type of dementia. It is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease.
Like other types of dementia, vascular dementia doesn't have any known cure. Although it's sometimes possible to slow down the development of symptoms, unfortunately they will get worse as the brain loses more and more of it functioning.


What is mixed dementia?
It’s also possible to have more than one type of dementia.
Some people with vascular dementia have another type of dementia too, most often Alzheimer’s disease. This is known as ‘mixed dementia’ and is more common in the oldest age groups.
This doesn’t mean you need to worry about seeing a different doctor. Specialists in dementia care will be able to support you or your loved one in managing the symptoms of both vascular and mixed dementia.


What causes vascular dementia?
Vascular dementia is caused by a lack of blood supply to your brain. This stops the surrounding brain cells from working properly, causing them to die over time.
The causes of a reduced blood supply to your brain include:
- small vessel disease – narrowing of small blood vessels deep inside your brain, often as a result of atherosclerosis (a build-up of fatty material inside your arteries)
- a stroke – where the blood supply to part of your brain is suddenly cut off, due to a blood clot or haemorrhage (a bleed)
- mini-strokes – known as transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs). These can cause tiny but widespread damage over time.


How is vascular dementia linked to atrial fibrillation and stroke?
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heart rhythm which increases your risk of stroke.
AF can cause a blood clot to form in one of the top chambers of your heart. This can be pumped out of your heart to your brain where it can cause a stroke.
As vascular dementia often develops after a stroke, people with AF are at higher risk.


What are the symptoms of vascular dementia?
The symptoms of vascular dementia can develop suddenly or gradually.
Your early symptoms will depend on which part of your brain has been affected. This means different people can experience different symptoms.
Vascular dementia can affect people of all ages, although it's often associated with growing older. If you're under 65 years old, it's known as 'young onset' or 'early onset' vascular dementia.
Early signs of vascular dementia include:
- concentration problems, such as struggling to focus during a conversation
- mood and personality changes, such as irritability or feeling low
- poor short-term memory
- difficulty with everyday skills, such as reading or driving
- difficulty with decision making and planning
- slowing down of thought processes
- difficulty saying your thoughts clearly.

In the later stages, you may experience symptoms such as:
- becoming increasingly confused and disorientated
- long-term memory loss and difficulty concentrating
- increasing difficulty remembering words and communicating
- difficulty with balance or falling frequently
- depression and personality changes
- in some cases, loss of bladder control.


How is vascular dementia diagnosed?
If you suspect you or a loved one might have vascular dementia, it’s important to talk to your GP as soon as possible. The GP will:
- explore what your issues are, when they started and how often they have been happening
- ask how these issues have been affecting your life and those around you
- carry out physical examinations, mental ability tests and other routine tests to help them rule out other physical or mental health causes.

Consider taking a loved one to you to the appointment, not only for support, but also to help the GP get a complete picture of how things have been for you.
If you can’t take a loved one, your GP may want to reach out to them on the phone so they can better understand your daily routine and skills. This will only happen with your permission.
If your GP suspects vascular dementia, they will refer you to a specialist or memory clinic. You may then have a CT or MRI scan of your brain to check for any abnormalities.
Unfortunately, getting an accurate diagnosis can sometimes take time. But it’s important you receive this so you can get the correct treatment and support.


How is vascular dementia treated?
Although we’re funding research to find new treatments, there's currently no cure for vascular dementia. However, there’s lots of help and support to help you to continue to live well.

With Medication:
You might be given medication to control high blood pressure or high cholesterol. This may have contributed to your condition and controlling it can help slow down the progression.
If you have vascular dementia, medication given for Alzheimer’s disease isn’t recommended. However, you could be given this medication if you have a mixed diagnosis of vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

With Lifestyle changes:
Research has shown that improving your lifestyle can help slow down the progression of vascular dementia. There are some small changes you can make that might reduce the chance of more damage to the blood vessels in your brain:
- eat healthily
- be physically active
- keep to a healthy weight and lose weight if necessary
- don't smoke
- cut down on alcohol
- control high blood pressure
- control cholesterol levels
- control blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes).

With Support programmes:
Your healthcare team may also suggest a range of social activities to improve your wellbeing and slow down the progression as much as possible. Some examples could be:
- group cognitive (this means the process of thinking, reasoning, or remembering) stimulation therapy – taking part in group activities and discussions to help with memory and connecting with others
- group reminiscence therapy - sharing life experiences, memories and stories from the past to help improve your wellbeing
- cognitive rehabilitation or occupational therapy – getting support in carrying out everyday tasks independently for as long as possible.


How to live with vascular dementia?
Some people diagnosed with vascular dementia are able to live well for many years. However, it's understandable if you feel overwhelmed and worried about how to cope.
On a practical level, there are many things you can do to support yourself, or someone diagnosed with vascular dementia. Some examples include:
- break complex tasks down into small steps
- use reminders, pill boxes or automatic medication dispensers so you don’t forget to take medications
- be aware of the things that make your symptoms worse, like noisy places
- keep to a regular routine and be sure to include activities you enjoy.

Vascular dementia is a progressive condition (this means it gets worse over time), so it’s likely you’ll need further support at some point. People involved in your ongoing care might include:
- healthcare professionals – your GP, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, or a specialist dementia nurse (such as an Admiral Nurse)
- social services – you and your loved ones or carer might be able to access support by having an assessment of your needs
- charities like Dementia UK can offer information, emotional support or advocacy services
- private care and support services, such as paid care workers or your council. Other local organisations may provide meals delivered to your home, if you are eligible.
