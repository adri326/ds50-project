What causes obesity or weight gain?
The causes of obesity include many things such as:
- portion sizes
- medical conditions and medications
- our genes
- stress and lack of sleep
- junk food advertising
- food labelling
- the fat and sugar content of every day foods
- the calorie content of food and drink served in restaurants and cafes

managing your weight can be difficult. A good place to start is to know about calories. The amount of energy in food or drink is measured in kilocalories (kcal), you may hear them called calories. You bring energy (calories) into your body by eating and you burn calories by being active. When you eat and drink more calories than you use up, your body keeps the excess calories as body fat. If you regularly eat more calories than you use up, you will start to gain weight. 
If you're concerned about your weight and you would like help to start managing it, you can speak to your GP. 


How does obesity increase the risk of heart and circulatory diseases?
Excess weight can lead to fatty material building up in your arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood to your organs). If the arteries that carry blood to your heart get damaged and clogged, it can lead to a heart attack. If this happens in the arteries that carry blood to your brain it can lead to a stroke or vascular dementia.


What is Body fat and body shape?
Everyone needs some body fat to stay healthy. But too much, particularly around the waist, puts your health at risk.
We have different types of fat in the body.
Many people tend to worry about the fat they can feel, which sits directly under the skin. This is called subcutaneous fat. But the bigger health risk comes from a different type of fat called visceral fat. This sits around our internal organs such as our heart and liver.


What are the effects of visceral fat on my health?
Visceral fat affects can:
- raise your blood cholesterol
- increase your blood pressure
- increase your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.
All these risk factors are closely linked with heart and circulatory diseases.
Carrying weight around your middle can make it harder for your body to use a hormone called insulin, which controls your blood glucose (sugar) levels. This can lead to type 2 diabetes. Having high levels of glucose in your bloodstream damages your arteries and increases your risk of heart and circulatory diseases.
People who are ‘apple’ shaped (carry excess weight around their middle) are at higher risk than those who are ‘pear’ shaped (carry weight around their hips, thighs and bottom) because the fat sits around their organs.


How else can excess weight affect me?
It may make you feel tired, and you may find you have low energy during the day. You may not be motivated to move around or exercise much, which can lead to low mood.
Losing weight can be a challenge and takes determination. But with the right information and some willpower, you can do it, and it will boost your confidence and give you more energy to do the things you enjoy.


How do I know if I have excess weight or obesity?
There are three measurements that are helpful to work out if you have excess weight or obesity:
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- waist circumference and
- Waist: height ratio
Here we set out the benefits of each one and show you how to take the measurement yourself, or where to get help. It’s helpful to use more than one measurement, and you may find it easy enough to do all three.
You may feel that measuring yourself is a big step, but it’s a positive first step to a healthier future for you.


How do I work out my BMI?
The first step to calculating your BMI is to measure your height and weight. Your GP or practice nurse can do this for you if you can’t do this at home.
Using your height and your weight, you’ll be able to work out your BMI using this formula: weight / (height * height)
Your BMI score will place you into one of these categories:
- Underweight: BMI below 18.5
- healthy weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
- overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9
- obesity class 1: BMI 30 to 34.9
- obesity class 2: BMI 35 to 39.9
- obesity class 3: BMI 40 or more
As BMI doesn’t take muscle mass into account, you may find yourself in the overweight or obese category if you’re muscular.


How do I measure my waist? What's the point of measuring my waist?
You can measure your waist to see whether you’re carrying too much fat around your middle. A larger waist measurement is often a sign that you have too much visceral fat, which can affect your health.
It’s important to note that your waist measurement will not be the same as the measurement you use when shopping for your jeans or trousers.
To measure your waist, place a tape measure around your middle, halfway between the bottom of your ribs and top of your hips, (just above the belly button). 
The recommended waist measurements are:
- below 37 inches (94cm) for men
- below 31.5 inches (80cm) for women.
People with waist sizes bigger than these are more likely to develop certain health problems, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.
Adults from certain ethnic backgrounds, including South Asian, Chinese, other Asian, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean, with waist sizes higher than 90cm for men and 80cm for women are at greater risk of developing the health problems described above.  


How do I work out my waist with my height ratio ?
If your BMI is less than 35, it is also recommended that you measure your waist to height ratio, which will also help you work out if you are carrying excess fat around your middle. It’s this type of fat (visceral fat) that increases your health risk.
It’s healthy to keep your waist to less than half your height :
- 0.4 to 0.49 – Healthy
- 0.5 to 0.59 – Increased risk of health problems
- 0.6 or more – Highest risk of health problems


What can I do to manage my weight?
Losing weight can be hard, but changes you make, like changing your eating habits and getting more active, can add up, so you start to see results. Many people feel once they start to make changes to their lifestyle they start to sleep better, have more energy and feel their mood boosted.
