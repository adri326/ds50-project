What is a stroke?
If the blood flow to the brain is interrupted, brain cells can get damaged because they aren’t getting the oxygen supply they need. A stroke can affect you in different ways, depending on which part of the brain hasn’t received the blood supply. This can affect your speech, as well as the way you think and move.


What are the signs of a stroke?
Act F.A.S.T to recognise the signs:
- Facial weakness – can they smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped?
- Arm weakness – can they raise both arms?
- Speech problems – can they speak clearly and can they understand what you're saying?
- Time – it's time to call 18 immediately if you see any of these symptoms.
It’s called F.A.S.T because timing is critical if you're having a stroke. You could lose millions of nerve cells for every minute without treatment. The longer you wait, the less chance of speech, movement and abilities being returned to what they were. Acting F.A.S.T really is lifesaving. Read more here.


What are the different types of stroke?
- Ischaemic strokes happen when an artery supplying blood to your brain is blocked by a blood clot.
- Haemorrhagic strokes happen when a blood vessel ruptures (or bursts), causing a bleed in the brain. This means less blood gets to the surrounding brain cells causing them to die.
- Mini-strokes, or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), happen when there’s an interruption in blood flow to part of the brain for a short time causing symptoms, such as temporary speech loss. TIA’s usually resolve after a few seconds or minutes.
If you think someone is having any of these symptoms you should call 18 immediately.


What increases my chance of having a stroke?
A risk factor increases your chance of developing a condition. Risk factors for a stroke are similar to those for heart diseases, such as angina or heart attacks. 
There are many things you can do to help lower your chances of a stroke: 
- eat healthily 
- be physically active 
- keep to a healthy weight and lose weight if necessary
- don't smoke
- cut down on alcohol
- control high blood pressure 
- control high cholesterol
- control blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes).
If you have an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF) your risk of stroke is increased. This is because AF increases the risk of a blood clot forming inside the top chambers of your heart. If this happens, it can travel to your brain and block the blood flow to your brain. 


How is a stroke treated in hospital?
As soon as possible, you’ll be taken for a brain scan. If you've had a stroke, you'll be closely monitored and depending on the type of stroke you may be given clot-busting medication (known as thrombolysis). The amount of time you stay in hospital depends on the type and severity of your stroke, your treatment, your general health and how quickly you recover.
It’s common to feel anxious, angry and upset  after having a stroke. Talk to your healthcare professionals and let them know if you want them to repeat anything. You can also ask for help and if you do they will discuss with you and your family if they feel think you’ll need support when you go home.
The Stroke Association has more detailed information on what happens to people with a stroke in hospital, including tests and treatment.


What will my recovery from stroke be like?
A stroke affects people in different ways. You’re likely to see the most improvement in the first few weeks of your recovery, usually while you're still in hospital. However, it can take months or sometimes years.
Your rehabilitation will begin in hospital where specialists, such as nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists will discuss what help you’ll need. The aim of rehabilitation is to help return you as close as possible to how you were before the stroke. They also support you to live as independently as you can.
If you’ve had a stroke, you may be at risk of developing vascular dementia. This happens when a stroke damages part of your brain, leading to symptoms such as concentration problems and personality changes. If you have any concerns you should speak to your GP.
Stroke is sudden and can be devastating, but many people continue to improve and there is help and support available.
