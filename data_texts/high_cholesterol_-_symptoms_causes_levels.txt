what is High cholesterol?
Cholesterol is a natural fatty substance in your blood. It’s produced in the liver and it is also in some of the foods we eat. Cholesterol is important to keep the cells in our bodies healthy.
High cholesterol means that you have too much cholesterol in your blood. There are many things that can cause this. If you don’t take steps to lower high cholesterol, it can increase your risk of heart attack and stroke. 


What causes high cholesterol?
Anyone can develop high cholesterol. It can be caused by many different things; some you can control, and others you can’t.
Things that cause high cholesterol which you can control:
Your lifestyle:
- eating too much saturated fat – this reduces the liver’s ability to remove cholesterol, so it builds up in the blood
- being physically inactive – being active raises the level of ‘good’ cholesterol and reduces the level of ‘bad’ cholesterol
- smoking - this can lead to high cholesterol levels and it causes tar to build up in your arteries, making it easier for cholesterol to stick to your artery walls.

Things that cause high cholesterol which you can't control:
- Your age, biological sex and ethnic background:
- getting older – having higher cholesterol is more likely as we age
- if your biological sex is male (you were assigned male at birth) – males are more likely to have high cholesterol
- your ethnic background – if you are from a south Asian background, you are more likely to have high cholesterol.

Your genes:
Genes carry the information that determines your features or characteristics that are passed on to you — or inherited — from your parents. Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), is an inherited condition, meaning you were born with it. It is often passed down through families in faulty genes and can lead to very high levels of cholesterol, even if you don’t have other risk factors.

Your general health:
- kidney disease - when your kidneys aren’t working well, it also changes the way your body handles cholesterol, which can lead to high cholesterol
- liver disease – an important job of the liver is to both produce cholesterol and clear it from the body, but if the liver isn’t working well it struggles to do this, increasing your risk of high cholesterol
- if you live with excess weight, especially around your middle
- if you have type 2 diabetes, you are at greater risk of having high cholesterol
- having an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism – when your body doesn’t make enough thyroid hormone)
- growth hormone deficiency (when not enough of the growth hormone is made). 


What is cholesterol? What are the types?
Cholesterol is used by all the cells in your body to keep them healthy. It is carried around your body to the cells that need it by proteins in your blood. Proteins are substances in your body that do most of the work in your cells and help keep your body’s tissues and organs working as they should.
When cholesterol and proteins combine, they're called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoproteins. One is good for your health; the other is bad.
High-density lipoproteins or HDL is known as ‘good’ cholesterol. It gets rid of the ‘bad’ cholesterol from your blood by taking cholesterol you don’t need back to the liver, where it is broken down and removed from your body.
Non-high-density lipoproteins or non-HDL is known as 'bad' cholesterol. Too much non-HDL leads to a build up of fatty deposits inside the walls of the blood vessels (channels that carry blood throughout your body). This builds up and narrows blood vessels, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke. 
You may also have heard 'bad' cholesterol being called 'LDL' cholesterol. This used to be the main measure of harmful types of cholesterol, but we now know that other forms of non-HDL cholesterol can also affect your health.


What are Triglycerides?
Our blood also contains a type of fat called triglycerides (found in fat cells), which can also contribute to narrowed arteries. Having excess weight, eating a lot of fatty and sugary foods or drinking too much alcohol can cause high triglyceride levels.
If you have had results from a lipid profile (a test that looks at all aspects of your cholesterol), you may see your triglycerides level – your doctor will be able to tell you if it's too high.
You can have a normal level of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol but still have a high triglyceride level. If you are found to have this, you may wish to speak to your GP to discuss what it means for you.


what are the symptoms of High cholesterol?
There are usually no symptoms of high cholesterol. But if left untreated, it can lead to heart attack and stroke.
It's often a hidden risk factor which means it can happen without us knowing until it's too late. That is why it's so important to get your cholesterol level checked.
However, if you have familial hypercholesterolaemia, you may have visible signs of high cholesterol. These include:
- Tendon xanthomata - swellings made from cholesterol on the knuckles of your hands, your knees or the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle.
- Xanthelasmas - small, yellow lumps of cholesterol near the inner corner of your eye.
- Corneal arcus - this is a pale white ring around the coloured part of your eye, your iris.


How can I get a cholesterol test?
You can ask your doctor to check your cholesterol levels, which are measured using a simple blood test. It is sometimes referred to as a ‘lipid profile’. Your GP or practice nurse will take a blood sample, to check for the following:
- evels of good cholesterol (HDL)
- evels of bad cholesterol (non-HDL)
- riglycerides.
You will also get a total cholesterol result. 
You may be offered a finger-prick cholesterol test. This can be done in some pharmacies, or as part of the NHS Health Check in England.
Cholesterol levels vary from person to person, but in general, for a healthy heart you need a low level of non-HDL level and a higher level of HDL.


What are normal levels for cholesterol?
The following information is just a guide. What matters is your individual risk, which a doctor can help you determine based on your results.
Total cholesterol: 5 or below (mmol/L)
HDL (good cholesterol): 1 or above (mmol/L)
Non-HDL (bad cholesterol): 4 or below (mmol/L)
Fasting triglycerides (when you're asked not to eat for several hours before the test): 1.7 or below (mmol/L)
Non-fasting triglycerides (when you eat as normal before the test): 2.3 or below (mmol/L)
Total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio: 6 or below (mmol/L)

If you have been told you have a high cholesterol level, it means you have too much 'bad' cholesterol in your blood, which increases your risk a heart attack or stroke. But a high level of 'good' (HDL) cholesterol can help keep that 'bad' (non-HDL) cholesterol in check.


How can I treat high cholesterol?
There is lots you can do to help lower your cholesterol:
- You can try ways of getting more active, which will help lower your cholesterol but also help you sleep better and feel more energetic
- You can cut down on alcohol and stop smoking
- You can enjoy trying healthy foods and recipes that are good for your heart.

If lifestyle changes are not enough to lower your high cholesterol, your doctor may suggest medication. If you are diagnosed with high cholesterol, your GP should invite you for a blood test every year to check your levels and adjust your treatment if necessary.
Statins are the main type of medicine used to reduce cholesterol. But there are other treatments available. Your doctor will let you know if you need to take any other drugs which help control your cholesterol levels. They may also refer you to a specialist called a lipidologist. 
If you have questions about your medicines, speak with your doctor or contact our Heart Helpline. You can also look at our publications for more information.
