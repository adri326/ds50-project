What’s heart bypass surgery?
Coronary bypass surgery is a type of surgery where the chest is opened and surgery is performed on the heart. It’s used to bypass – or ‘get around’ - the narrowed or blocked sections of your coronary arteries.
Your surgeon takes a blood vessel (a tube that blood moves through) and attaches it between the aorta (the main blood vessel leaving the heart) and a point along the coronary artery.
In most cases, at least one of the blood vessels used as a bypass graft is an artery from your chest called the internal mammary artery. Blood vessels such as a vein from your legs and sometimes an artery from your arms are used for the other grafts.
You might need one graft, but some people need more. One, two, three and four grafts are often called single, double, triple or quadruple bypasses.


Do I need heart bypass surgery?
You may need bypass surgery if you’ve been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Coronary heart disease is when your coronary arteries (which move blood to the heart) get narrowed or blocked by a build-up of fatty material within their walls.
The build-up of material is a condition called atherosclerosis, which can cause:
- angina – usually a pain or discomfort in your chest when your heart muscle isn’t getting enough blood
- heart attack – when the fatty material breaks down it can become a blood clot which can block your artery and cut off the supply of blood to your heart
- peripheral arterial disease (PAD) – when your arteries become narrow so blood can’t get to your leg muscles, causing pain in your calves, hips, buttocks and thighs – usually when you’re walking or exercising
- stroke - when the blood supply to your brain is blocked. 


What happens during heart bypass surgery?
Before the operation, you’ll be given medicine (general anaesthetic) that puts you to sleep. The medicine is injected or inhaled as a gas through a mask. A specialist doctor (called an anaesthetist) gives you the medicine before the surgery starts and stays with you to make sure you have enough to keep you asleep.
You’ll then go into the operating room for the surgery which normally lasts three to six hours. Surgeons usually make a cut down the middle of the breastbone (the long flat bone in the middle of the chest) to reach your heart. If you have a vein graft from your leg or an artery graft from your arm, they will make smaller cuts in these places too.
A heart-lung bypass machine will move the blood around your body while the surgeon operates on your heart. Some surgeons may carry out coronary bypass operations without this machine. This is called beating heart surgery.
Your surgeon may do newer bypass surgeries like endoscopic or minimally invasive surgery. These involve making several small cuts and using an endoscope camera to see the blood vessels and heart. Surgeons do this because it can help you get up out of bed sooner and speed up recovery.
If your surgeon needs to cut your breastbone, you’ll have a wound down the middle of your chest. It’s normal to be worried or scared about having scars after surgery but you're not alone. Listen to people who have had heart surgery and how they learned to accept their scars.
Your surgeon will be around to answer any questions you may have before and after surgery. This includes talking about the different types of surgeries available to you.


What should I do before heart bypass surgery?
If your doctor recommends surgery, ask them any questions you may have about it. You can then begin to prepare for the surgery, which can help reduce any stress and anxiety you may feel. Preparation may include:
- arranging for someone to look after you during recovery
- continuing to take medication
- eating healthy foods (use our recipe finder for tasty and heart healthy ideas)
- managing your weight
- looking after your mental health
- organising transport to and from the hospital
- organising time off from work
- setting up a recovery space at home
- staying active.
Being as prepared as possible before surgery can help speed up the time it takes to recover. It can also help you feel less worried. Read our five top tips on getting in shape before surgery so you’re as prepared as possible.


What happens after heart bypass surgery?
After your operation, you’ll be moved to intensive care or a specialist recovery department. This is where people who need special monitoring after surgery go so a close eye can be kept on them.
When your doctor decides that you don’t need intensive care anymore, you’ll be moved to the cardiac ward or the high dependency unit which is for people who need a higher level of care than normal.
After that, you can begin your recovery. You should generally be able to sit in a chair after one day, walk after three days and use stairs after five or six days. When you go home, you’ll need to relax for a few weeks.
You should be able to do most of your normal activities after about six weeks, including working, driving and sex. If you have a heavy manual job, you may need to rest for longer.
In many hospitals, after a heart bypass operation, a member of the cardiac specialist team will see you on the ward to give you information about your condition and the treatment you’ve had.
They’ll talk to you about making lifestyle changes and how to reduce your risk factors (the things that increase your risk of heart disease) to help protect your heart in the future. They’ll offer you cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) to get you fit and strong again too.
It’s okay to feel low after surgery and the team can help you if you want to talk with them. Many people say their time in hospital becomes a blur. You may find it helpful to write down or have someone with you to help remember the information you get throughout your journey.
It's important to look after your heart health long term so you don’t develop more heart problems. You can do this by making lifestyle changes such as:
- avoiding or drinking less alcohol (no more than the recommended limit of 14 units a week)
- eating healthier foods
- not smoking or using tobacco products
- staying active.
Living a healthier lifestyle can be hard at first, but it’s important for your overall quality of life.

You can also ask your doctor or nurse any questions about your recovery.


What are the benefits of heart bypass surgery?
The benefits and risks of heart bypass surgery are different for everyone and depend on the seriousness of your heart disease, type of operation you need, your age, and your overall health. The benefits of surgery include:
- better sleep – thanks to improved symptoms of conditions like less pain from angina and peripheral arterial disease
- better mood and mental health – due to reduced risk of angina, heart attack, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and other conditions caused by coronary heart disease
- more energy – everyday tasks and physical activities become easier and more enjoyable.


What are the risks of heart bypass surgery?
All types of surgery come with risk. With heart bypass surgery, the risks can include:
- an irregular heartbeat
- bleeding
- blood clots
- complications after surgery like a heart attack or stroke
- general anaesthesia that can cause short-term effects after surgery like confusion, lack of concentration, sickness and dizziness
- wound infection.
If you’re worried or have more questions, we strongly encourage you to ask your doctor. They’ll be able to answer any questions specific to you and your surgery.


Do I have to have heart bypass surgery?
If your doctor says you need surgery, talk to them about the treatment options and what the right choice is for you. Heart bypass surgery may not be an option if the arteries around your heart are too narrow or blocked. Instead, your doctor may want to do a coronary angioplasty and stent insertion operation.
A coronary angioplasty is where a special kind of balloon is gently blown up inside the coronary artery to open it up. A stainless steel mesh called a stent is put in the artery to keep it open and let blood flow normally again. The balloon will be taken out.
Before deciding to do an angioplasty, you’ll have an angiogram (type of x-ray) that shows how blocked your arteries are. Your doctor will then know what the best treatment is for you. Before and after your surgery, you may need to take medications to support your heart. In some cases, coronary heart disease can be treated with different medications like:
- antiplatelets – which help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke
- beta blockers – which help reduce the risk of heart conditions like angina and heart attack
- statins - which lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of angina, heart attack and stroke.
