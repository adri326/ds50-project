What does smoking do to my heart and circulatory system?
The chemicals in cigarettes make the walls of your arteries sticky. This causes fatty material to stick to the walls. The fatty material can begin to clog your arteries and reduce the space for blood to flow properly.

- If the arteries that carry blood to your heart get clogged, it can lead to a heart attack.
- If the arteries that carry blood to your brain get clogged, it can lead to a stroke.

Smoking can also affect your heart and blood vessels by:
- increasing your risk of blood clots
- causing an instant rise to your heart rate
- causing an instant rise to your blood pressure
- reducing the amount of oxygen delivered to the rest of your body.


What are the benefits of quitting smoking?
You might notice benefits sooner than you think:
- your heart rate and blood pressure will begin to return to normal after 20 minutes
- your sense of smell and taste will begin to improve after 2-3 days
- your breathing will begin to improve, and exercise may be easier after 2-12 weeks
- your risk of a heart attack is half that of a smoker after 1 year.

Quitting smoking also has other benefits like:
- you will have fresher breath and whiter teeth
- your skin might look younger and age less quickly
- you might have more energy, feel less tired and get less headaches
- your immune system will find it easier to fight off colds and flu
- your sex drive may increase, and it can improve your fertility
- you will protect the health of your children, family and friends.

It’s never too late to benefit from stopping smoking. On average, men will add 10 years to their life if they quit by the age of 30. Many people will add 3 years to their life if they quit by the aged of 60. Being a non-smoker can also improve your chances of being more physically active and healthier as you get older.


Are smoking alternatives less harmful than cigarettes?
All types of smoking and smoking alternatives are bad for your health.
Some smoking alternatives are less harmful than cigarettes and they can help you quit smoking. But they should only be used to help you quit smoking for good. Other smoking alternatives are just as harmful or more harmful than cigarettes.


Are e-cigaretes dangerous my health? Is vaping harmful for my health?
E-cigarettes, or vapes, are less harmful than regular cigarettes and they can be used to help you quit smoking. An e-cigarette is a device that you breath in vapour (steam) from rather than smoke.
The vapour contains nicotine, the addictive chemical used in cigarettes. E-cigarettes don’t burn tobacco and they don’t produce tar or carbon monoxide.
E-cigarettes can help you quit smoking by managing your cravings for nicotine. But because they use nicotine, e-cigarettes can be addictive. You should only use your e-cigarette when you really need it.
E-cigarettes should not be used by non-smokers or young people.


Is shisha dangerous for my health?
Shisha is not safer than smoking cigarettes. A specially prepared tobacco is heated to produce smoke. The smoke bubbles through a bowl of water and into a long hose-like pipe to be breathed in. Like cigarettes, shisha tobacco can contain:
- nicotine
- tar
- carbon monoxide
- heavy metals such as arsenic and lead.
Even if you use tobacco-free shisha, the smoke still produces harmful levels of toxins. This can be either just as bad for you or even more harmful than smoke from tobacco-based shisha.
In a shisha session (which usually lasts 20-80 minutes), a shisha smoker can inhale the same amount of smoke as a cigarette smoker consuming over 100 cigarettes.


Is Smokeless tobacco harmful for my health?
Smokeless tobacco is not safer than smoking cigarettes. It’s a type of tobacco that can either be chewed, sucked, or inhaled without producing smoke.
Most smokeless tobaccos have the same amount of nicotine as cigarettes. They can also have more than 25 chemicals that are known to cause cancer. Using smokeless tobacco can also increase your risk of having:
- complicated pregnancies
- mouth and tooth problems
- heart and circulatory diseases.


Are Low tar cigarettes harmful for my health?
Smoking ‘low tar’ cigarettes is not safer than smoking regular cigarettes. Some cigarette packages describe the product as ‘low tar’, but this is misleading. Most ‘low tar’ cigarettes have the same amount of harmful chemicals as regular cigarettes.
‘Low tar’ cigarettes are often found in countries where the process of making cigarettes is less regulated than in the UK.


Is second-hand smoke harmful?
Yes, second-hand smoke is harmful. Second-hand smoke (also known as passive smoke) is when you breathe in the smoke in the air from someone else’s cigarette and the smoke they breathe out.
When the people around you breathe in your cigarette smoke, it increases their risk of developing:
- breathing problems
- cancers like lung cancer
- heart and circulatory diseases like strokes and heart attacks.

Second-hand smoke is very dangerous for children. They are 3 times more likely to get lung cancer in later life than children who live with non-smokers. Children who live in a home with smokers can have double the risk of getting illnesses like:
- pneumonia
- ear infections
- wheezing and asthma.
You can help to protect your loved ones, friends and colleagues from the dangers of second-hand smoke by quitting.


How can I quit smoking?
If you quit smoking, you will greatly improve your health and the health of everyone around you. It may feel hard to resist the temptation to smoke sometimes. But you can make small changes to make it easier to stick to it:
- Try to think positively – even if you’ve tried to quit before and didn’t manage it, don’t let it put you off trying again.
- Set a date to quit and tell your family, friends and colleagues so they can help you stick to it.
- Plan how you will deal with your cravings when you’re at events and times where you would usually smoke.
- If you usually smoke after meals, eat foods that can make cigarettes taste bad like cheese, fruit and vegetables. Or change your routine to keep your mind busy when you would usually smoke, like washing the dishes straight after eating.
- Cravings usually last around 5 minutes. Plan things you can do in 5 minutes to stay busy for when you get cravings.
- When you’re out, hold your drink with the hand that used to hold cigarettes and use a straw. This will help to keep your hands and mouth busy.
- When you get a craving, remind yourself of why you’re quitting. You may want to carry a picture of your family with you to look at if you’re tempted to smoke.
You are not alone. Aside from your family and friends, you can get support from healthcare professionals, stop smoking programmes and nicotine replacement therapy.
