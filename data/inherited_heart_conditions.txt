What are Inherited heart conditions?
Inherited heart conditions are passed on through families. They’re sometimes called genetic heart conditions or inherited cardiac conditions. They can affect people of any age. If left untreated, some inherited heart conditions can be life-threatening.


What are the symptoms of an inherited heart condition?
Some people with an inherited heart condition have no symptoms, while other people develop symptoms such as:
- dizzy spells 
- palpitations
- blackouts
- shortness of breath.
For many families, the first sign there’s something wrong is when someone dies suddenly, with no obvious cause.  This is known as sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS).


What are the different types of inherited heart condition?
The most common inherited heart conditions are cardiomyopathies and channelopathies.

Inherited cardiomyopathies:
- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
- dilated cardiomyopathy 
- arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

Channelopathies (which can cause abnormal heart rhythms):
- long QT syndrome (LQTS)
- brugada syndrome 
- catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) 
- progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD).

Inherited conditions which increase your risk of heart disease:
- familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) – very high cholesterol levels.


What causes an inherited heart condition? 
Your body is made up of trillions of cells. Each cell has a nucleus, containing information that makes you unique. This information is called your genes. We all have between 20,000 and 25,000 different genes each.
Genes affect how we look and how our bodies work, and we inherit them from our parents. Inherited heart conditions are caused by a fault (or mutation) in one or more of our genes. If one of your parents has a faulty gene, there’s a 50:50 chance you could have it too. If you do, then there’s also a 50:50 chance you could pass it on to your children.
It’s possible to have a faulty gene that can lead to a heart condition, but you may never develop any signs or symptoms of the condition itself. If this happens, you can still pass the faulty gene onto your child and there’s no way of knowing how it may affect them.


How can I test for an inherited heart condition ?
It can be hard to diagnose an inherited heart condition. Your doctor or specialist might think you have one if:
- a member of your family has an inherited heart condition 
- there’s a history of cardiac arrests or premature deaths in your family
- a death in the family is hard to explain or thought to be caused by a faulty gene
- you’ve been diagnosed with angina or had a heart attack at a young age, in which case your doctor may suspect you have FH.
If someone in your family has been diagnosed with an inherited heart condition, your doctor may suggest that you have tests such as an ECG or echocardiogram.


What should I do when a family member is diagnosed with an inherited heart condition ?
If you’re a relative of someone who has been diagnosed with an inherited heart condition (IHC), it’s recommended that you’re referred to a specialist centre.  Here you’ll be tested to see if you have the same faulty gene as your family member, which could lead to an IHC. This type of genetic testing through families is called cascade testing.


Are there Treatment for an inherited heart condition ?
Different inherited heart conditions require different treatments and your doctor or specialist will explain what’s right for your condition.
Treatment for an IHC includes:
- changes to your lifestyle
- medication 
- implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs).
