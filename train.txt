### Question:
Should I exercise?

### Answer:
It’s normal to worry whether you should exercise if you’ve got a heart problem. Most people will still be able to and feel the benefits of staying active. In most cases, getting your muscles and lungs working better helps put less strain on your heart. However, there are some things to keep in mind before getting active:
- heart conditions – with some conditions, you may have to think about whether you can use weights, or how intense your exercise can be. If you use GTN spray to manage your chest pain, speak to your doctor or pharmacist about how you can use it alongside exercise
- medications – some may affect your exercise. For example, beta blockers affect your heart rate and may make you feel more tired. Talk with your doctor to find the medication that works for you
- implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) & pacemakers – most people with these implanted devices can exercise safely and your doctor should tell you if you have any limits to what you should do. This often means sticking to moderate intensity exercise (like walking and gardening) and avoiding contact sports like rugby
- listen to your body – you should only exercise if you’re feeling well enough to do so. If you start to feel symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations (the feeling like your heart is pounding, or skipping a beat) or unusual shortness of breath, you may need to scale back your exercise. Speak to your doctor If you’re experiencing this
- the weather – if it’s too hot or too cold, your heart may be under more strain to exercise. If this is the case, try a low-stress activity like stretching instead.

### Question:
What should I do before heart bypass surgery?

### Answer:
If your doctor recommends surgery, ask them any questions you may have about it. You can then begin to prepare for the surgery, which can help reduce any stress and anxiety you may feel. Preparation may include:
- arranging for someone to look after you during recovery
- continuing to take medication
- eating healthy foods (use our recipe finder for tasty and heart healthy ideas)
- managing your weight
- looking after your mental health
- organising transport to and from the hospital
- organising time off from work
- setting up a recovery space at home
- staying active.
Being as prepared as possible before surgery can help speed up the time it takes to recover. It can also help you feel less worried. Read our five top tips on getting in shape before surgery so you’re as prepared as possible.

### Question:
What type of exercise should I do?

### Answer:
Not all exercise is the same and the different types of exercise you do have different benefits for your body. The recommended types of exercise for improving heart health are:
- aerobic exercise - when you’re moving your body in a way that makes you warm and slightly out of breath like when walking, cycling, doing housework or gardening. Over time, this type of exercise helps your heart and circulatory system to work better by helping to lower your blood pressure and resting heart rate, improving cholesterol levels and helping you maintain a healthy weight
- balance and flexibility exercise – exercise like yoga, tai chi and Pilates where we hold our bodies in less stable positions. These exercises make sure our muscles don’t get too tight and keep us flexible, helping avoid pain or injury and reduce the risk of having falls
- resistance exercise – resistance training like lifting weights or using resistance bands and cables to strengthen your muscles. The stronger your muscles are, the harder they can work which takes the strain off your heart making it easier to do everyday tasks. Check in with your doctor before you start any resistance training as it may not be suitable for some people with heart conditions.

It’s important to remember that getting active doesn’t have to mean spending lots of time doing an activity that you may not enjoy. It can be something as simple as playing with your grandkids, walking to the shop or gardening. If it gets you a little out of breath, you’re being active.
For most people, your weekly exercise should be a combination of aerobic, resistance and flexibility and balance activities for well-rounded health.

### Question:
What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?

### Answer:
Most people don't know they have high blood pressure because there aren't obvious symptoms. That's why it's so important to get your blood pressure checked regularly.
Rarely, it can cause symptoms like blurred vision, headaches and nosebleeds.
### End Answer

### Question:
What does smoking do to my heart and circulatory system?

### Answer:
The chemicals in cigarettes make the walls of your arteries sticky. This causes fatty material to stick to the walls. The fatty material can begin to clog your arteries and reduce the space for blood to flow properly.

- If the arteries that carry blood to your heart get clogged, it can lead to a heart attack.
- If the arteries that carry blood to your brain get clogged, it can lead to a stroke.

Smoking can also affect your heart and blood vessels by:
- increasing your risk of blood clots
- causing an instant rise to your heart rate
- causing an instant rise to your blood pressure
- reducing the amount of oxygen delivered to the rest of your body.

### Question:
How can atherosclerosis affect me?

### Answer:
If left untreated, atherosclerosis can potentially lead to serious health problems, like: 
- angina – usually a pain or discomfort in your chest that happens when your heart muscle isn’t getting enough blood 
- coronary heart disease - when the main arteries of your heart become narrowed or blocked by fatty material (plaque) by a build-up of fatty material within their walls.
- heart attack – if the fatty material breaks down and becomes a blood clot, it can block your artery and cut off the supply of blood to your heart
- stroke - when enough blood can’t get to your brain. If the blood supply is limited for a short time, this can cause a mini-stroke (called a TIA). If the fatty material breaks down and becomes a blood clot, it can block the artery and cause a stroke
- peripheral arterial disease (or PAD) – when enough blood can’t get to your leg muscles. This can cause pain in your calves, hips, buttocks and thighs – usually when you’re walking or exercising.
### End Answer

### Question:
How is coronary heart disease diagnosed?

### Answer:
Your doctor will be able to tell whether you have coronary heart disease if you're experiencing symptoms of angina.
- electrocardiogram (ECG)
- echocardiogram
- chest x-ray
- coronary angiogram.

You should get a health check to assess your risk of coronary heart disease if:
- you’re between 40 and 74 years old and live in England
- you’re between 40 and 64 and live in Scotland
- you live in Northern Ireland (where this is known as a cardiac risk factor assessment).
### End Answer

### Question:
What's atherosclerosis?

### Answer:
Atherosclerosis is a common condition that can affect anyone, particularly if you’re over 65 or have a family history of heart or circulatory diseases. It’s caused by a build-up of fatty material called atheroma (or plaque) in your artery walls (where blood passes from the heart to the rest of the body).
Atheroma builds up as the walls of your arteries harden and narrow until blood can’t pass properly from your heart to the rest of your body. Many people don’t know they have atherosclerosis since atheroma takes time to build up and often doesn’t cause symptoms until it’s serious.
Lifestyle, health conditions and family history all effect whether you’ll get it. Atherosclerosis isn’t reversible but lifestyle choices are important in preventing the risk and improving the symptoms of it.

### End Answer

### Question:
Do I need heart bypass surgery?

### Answer:
You may need bypass surgery if you’ve been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Coronary heart disease is when your coronary arteries (which move blood to the heart) get narrowed or blocked by a build-up of fatty material within their walls.
The build-up of material is a condition called atherosclerosis, which can cause:
- angina – usually a pain or discomfort in your chest when your heart muscle isn’t getting enough blood
- heart attack – when the fatty material breaks down it can become a blood clot which can block your artery and cut off the supply of blood to your heart
- peripheral arterial disease (PAD) – when your arteries become narrow so blood can’t get to your leg muscles, causing pain in your calves, hips, buttocks and thighs – usually when you’re walking or exercising
- stroke - when the blood supply to your brain is blocked. 
### End Answer

### Question:
How is a heart attack diagnosed?

### Answer:
If you think you’re having a heart attack, you need to call 999 for an ambulance. Don’t try and take yourself to hospital, as the ambulance team will give you the best care and do tests on the way.
In the ambulance, the team will do an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical activity of your heart. This is an important test to find out if you're having a heart attack. If the ECG shows you’re having a heart attack, you’ll be taken to a specialist centre to get the best treatment.
Whether or not the ECG confirms a heart attack, you’ll need further tests to find out what’s going on. These tests may include:
- an assessment of your symptoms and medical history
- physical examinations, including measuring your blood pressure and monitoring your heart rhythm and heart rate
- blood tests to see if there’s been any damage to your heart muscle
- more ECGs 
- an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of your heart).
You might hear a heart attack being called acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary thrombosis while you're at hospital.

### Question:
What is gestational diabetes?

### Answer:
Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after giving birth.
It can happen at any stage of pregnancy, but is more common in the second or third trimester.
It happens when your body cannot produce enough insulin – a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels – to meet your extra needs in pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes can cause problems for you and your baby during pregnancy and after birth. But the risks can be reduced if the condition is detected early and well managed.
### End Answer

### Question:
How is high blood pressure diagnosed?

### Answer:
Your blood pressure will usually need to be checked more than once to confirm a diagnosis of high blood pressure.
This is because blood pressure can go up and down a lot during the day. When people have their blood pressure checked in the clinic it can be higher than expected, especially if they feel nervous or anxious.
If your blood pressure is high in the clinic, you might be advised to:
- Take additional readings at home using a 24-hour monitor that checks your blood pressure throughout the day (called ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, or ABPM).
- Record additional readings at home using your own blood pressure monitor (called home blood pressure monitoring, or HBPM). You can also ask your GP practice if they are part of any schemes where you can loan a blood pressure monitor from them.

If you’ve been asked to monitor your blood pressure at home, your GP will ask you to check your blood pressure over several days. This can include taking a series of recordings (at least two), twice a day, in the morning and evening.
By looking at all your blood pressure readings over a few days, your GP can work out what your 'average’ blood pressure is.

### Question:
What are the complications of diabetes? 

### Answer:
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes can cause other health problems if it’s not controlled properly. But try to not let this worry you, your doctor will review your symptoms and your treatment plan with you to reduce your risk of complications. 
Some of the complications of diabetes can occur at any time and some can build up over time. The complications can include: 
- eye and sight problems 
- gum disease and teeth problems 
- difficulty getting sexually aroused 
- being more likely to get thrush or urinary tract infections 
- nerve damage which might affect feeling, moving or hearing 
- heart and circulatory diseases like heart attack, stroke and vascular dementia 
- feeling shaky, sweaty, or disorientated from a quick rise or dip in blood sugar levels 
- diabetic ketoacidosis – when the body can’t use sugar for energy it starts to use fat instead, this mostly affects type 1 diabetics.

### Question:
What should I eat and drink?

### Answer:
Whatever your activity level, to stay fit and healthy everyone needs a good balance and variety of foods. This means choosing healthy carbohydrates, lean proteins, eating more fruit and vegetables and keeping hydrated.
- carbohydrates - these are your body’s main source of energy when you're exercising. It’s best to choose high fibre, wholegrain varieties of oats, pasta, rice, breads and cereals. Carbohydrates provide the slow release of energy you need to fuel your exercise. There’s no need to eat extra carbohydrates if you’re active unless you’re training for longer events
- fruit and vegetables - these are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fibre which help keep your body and immune system healthy when you exercise. Aim for at least five portions a day
- protein - known as the building blocks of life, these help your body grow and repair. You should try and include a portion of protein like lean meat, fish, eggs, dairy or alternatives sources like peas, pulses or beans with most meals
- fluids - exercising raises your body temperature and your body tries to cool down by sweating. This causes a loss of water and salts through the skin. How much fluid you need depends on how long you exercise for, the temperature, and the amount you sweat. For most people, unless you are exercising for more than an hour, drinking 6-8 glasses of fluid (water, squash, fruit juice, caffeine-free teas) a day is a good idea.

Allow enough time to eat and drink before exercising to ensure your food is fully digested and avoid feeling sick or uncomfortable during exercise. Try to have a balanced meal 2-3 hours before exercising.
It’s just as important to have a healthy diet as it is to exercise. Use our recipe finder for hundreds of delicious and healthy meal ideas packed with the nutrients you need for being active.

### Question:
What are normal levels for cholesterol?

### Answer:
The following information is just a guide. What matters is your individual risk, which a doctor can help you determine based on your results.
Total cholesterol: 5 or below (mmol/L)
HDL (good cholesterol): 1 or above (mmol/L)
Non-HDL (bad cholesterol): 4 or below (mmol/L)
Fasting triglycerides (when you're asked not to eat for several hours before the test): 1.7 or below (mmol/L)
Non-fasting triglycerides (when you eat as normal before the test): 2.3 or below (mmol/L)
Total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio: 6 or below (mmol/L)

If you have been told you have a high cholesterol level, it means you have too much 'bad' cholesterol in your blood, which increases your risk a heart attack or stroke. But a high level of 'good' (HDL) cholesterol can help keep that 'bad' (non-HDL) cholesterol in check.

### Question:
How is a heart attack treated?

### Answer:
Quick treatment to get the blood flowing to your heart muscle again is important. This can reduce the amount of permanent damage to your heart and save your life. 
Many people need to have emergency treatment to restore the blood flow. Emergency treatment may include: 
- Coronary angioplasty - putting one or more stents (which are like small pieces of scaffolding) into the narrowed or blocked artery to keep it open and improve the blood supply to the heart.
- Thrombolysis - involves giving you "clot-busting" medicine to dissolve the blood clot that's blocking the coronary artery.
- Coronary bypass surgery - helps to bring back normal blood flow by attaching a blood vessel from your leg, arm or chest in your heart to go around the blocked artery.
You’ll discuss with your doctor about which of these treatments might be best for you.

### Question:
What causes high blood pressure?

### Answer:
In most cases, there isn't a specific reason for the cause of high blood pressure, but most people develop it because of their diet, lifestyle or medical condition.
You might be more at risk if you:
- are over the age of 65
- have someone in your family with high blood pressure
- are someone who smokes
- drink too much alcohol
- eat too much salt and not enough fruit and vegetables
- don't get enough exercise
- are overweight, especially around your mid-section.
People living in deprived areas are also at higher risk of having high blood pressure, as well as people who are of black African or black Caribbean descent. Changes in your diet and increasing activity levels will help improve your blood pressure.
For some people, a cause of high blood pressure is found. This is known as ‘secondary hypertension’.
Examples of secondary hypertension include:
- kidney disease
- diabetes
- a condition called obstructive sleep apnoea, which can lead to disturbed sleep
- some medicines, such as oral contraceptives
- some over-the-counter and herbal medicines.
If you are worried that any medicine or remedy might affect your blood pressure, ask your doctor or pharmacist about it.

### Question:
Is shisha dangerous for my health?

### Answer:
Shisha is not safer than smoking cigarettes. A specially prepared tobacco is heated to produce smoke. The smoke bubbles through a bowl of water and into a long hose-like pipe to be breathed in. Like cigarettes, shisha tobacco can contain:
- nicotine
- tar
- carbon monoxide
- heavy metals such as arsenic and lead.
Even if you use tobacco-free shisha, the smoke still produces harmful levels of toxins. This can be either just as bad for you or even more harmful than smoke from tobacco-based shisha.
In a shisha session (which usually lasts 20-80 minutes), a shisha smoker can inhale the same amount of smoke as a cigarette smoker consuming over 100 cigarettes.

### Question:
Why would you need a stent in your heart?

### Answer:
Your coronary arteries play a vital role in keeping your heart healthy. But in some people, fatty deposits can build up and narrow or block the coronary arteries (this is called atherosclerosis, which can cause coronary heart disease). If not enough blood is flowing through the coronary arteries, this can lead to angina or a heart attack.
Coronary angioplasty widens narrowed coronary arteries. This procedure is used:
- In severe cases of angina, where medication isn’t working
- As an emergency treatment for people during a heart attack
Angioplasty isn’t for everyone. Depending on your health and individual heart conditions, you may be advised that you need coronary artery bypass surgery.

### Question:
 Is vaping harmful for my health?

### Answer:
E-cigarettes, or vapes, are less harmful than regular cigarettes and they can be used to help you quit smoking. An e-cigarette is a device that you breath in vapour (steam) from rather than smoke.
The vapour contains nicotine, the addictive chemical used in cigarettes. E-cigarettes don’t burn tobacco and they don’t produce tar or carbon monoxide.
E-cigarettes can help you quit smoking by managing your cravings for nicotine. But because they use nicotine, e-cigarettes can be addictive. You should only use your e-cigarette when you really need it.
E-cigarettes should not be used by non-smokers or young people.

### Question:
How can gestational diabetes affect my pregnancy?

### Answer:
Most women with gestational diabetes have otherwise normal pregnancies with healthy babies.However, gestational diabetes can cause problems such as:
- your baby growing larger than usual – this may lead to difficulties during the delivery and increases the likelihood of needing induced labour or a caesarean section
- polyhydramnios – too much amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby) in the womb, which can cause premature labour or problems at delivery
- premature birth – giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy
- pre-eclampsia – a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and can lead to pregnancy complications if not treated
- your baby developing low blood sugar or yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) after he or she is born, which may require treatment in hospital
- the loss of your baby (stillbirth) – though this is rare
Having gestational diabetes also means you're at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future.

### Question:
What are Triglycerides?

### Answer:
Our blood also contains a type of fat called triglycerides (found in fat cells), which can also contribute to narrowed arteries. Having excess weight, eating a lot of fatty and sugary foods or drinking too much alcohol can cause high triglyceride levels.
If you have had results from a lipid profile (a test that looks at all aspects of your cholesterol), you may see your triglycerides level – your doctor will be able to tell you if it's too high.
You can have a normal level of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol but still have a high triglyceride level. If you are found to have this, you may wish to speak to your GP to discuss what it means for you.

How can I test for an inherited heart condition ?

### Answer:
It can be hard to diagnose an inherited heart condition. Your doctor or specialist might think you have one if:
- a member of your family has an inherited heart condition 
- there’s a history of cardiac arrests or premature deaths in your family
- a death in the family is hard to explain or thought to be caused by a faulty gene
- you’ve been diagnosed with angina or had a heart attack at a young age, in which case your doctor may suspect you have FH.
If someone in your family has been diagnosed with an inherited heart condition, your doctor may suggest that you have tests such as an ECG or echocardiogram.
### End Answer

### Question:
Why is it important to know your blood pressure?

### Answer:
High blood pressure is a serious condition.
Your arteries are normally stretchy, so they can cope with your blood pressure going up and down. But with high blood pressure, your arteries lose their stretchiness, becoming stiff or narrow.
This narrowing makes it easier for fatty material (atheroma) to build up. This narrowing and damage to the arteries lining your heart or brain could trigger a life-threatening heart attack or stroke.
Around 50% of heart attacks and strokes are associated with high blood pressure
If left untreated, high blood pressure can also lead to complications such as:
- kidney failure
- heart failure
- problems with your sight
- vascular dementia.

If you’ve not been diagnosed with angina and you have chest pain that stops after a few minutes of resting, get an urgent doctor’s appointment.  
If the pain does not stop after a few minutes of rest, call 999 immediately because you could be having a heart attack. 
If you’ve been diagnosed with angina but it feels worse, happens more often, or has changed in any way, talk to your doctor as soon as you can. 
If your chest pain doesn’t stop after a few minutes’ rest, and one or two doses of your nitrate medication, you should call 999 immediately because this could be a heart attack. 
### End Answer

### Question:
What’s the treatment for angina?

### Answer:
- Medication, such as nitrate sprays, patches and pills may help control your symptoms. Your doctor might also suggest you take medication to reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke.
- Some people need treatments such as a coronary angioplasty where a special kind of balloon is gently inflated to open a narrowed artery. Many people also have a type of mesh called a stent inserted to keep the artery open. Heart bypass surgery may also be an option.
- Simple lifestyle changes may help reduce your symptoms of angina, improve your overall health and reduce your risk of a heart attack in the future.

### Question:
What causes vascular dementia?

### Answer:
Vascular dementia is caused by a lack of blood supply to your brain. This stops the surrounding brain cells from working properly, causing them to die over time.
The causes of a reduced blood supply to your brain include:
- small vessel disease – narrowing of small blood vessels deep inside your brain, often as a result of atherosclerosis (a build-up of fatty material inside your arteries)
- a stroke – where the blood supply to part of your brain is suddenly cut off, due to a blood clot or haemorrhage (a bleed)
- mini-strokes – known as transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs). These can cause tiny but widespread damage over time.
### End Answer

### Question:
What will my recovery from stroke be like?

### Answer:
A stroke affects people in different ways. You’re likely to see the most improvement in the first few weeks of your recovery, usually while you're still in hospital. However, it can take months or sometimes years.
Your rehabilitation will begin in hospital where specialists, such as nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists will discuss what help you’ll need. The aim of rehabilitation is to help return you as close as possible to how you were before the stroke. They also support you to live as independently as you can.
If you’ve had a stroke, you may be at risk of developing vascular dementia. This happens when a stroke damages part of your brain, leading to symptoms such as concentration problems and personality changes. If you have any concerns you should speak to your GP.
Stroke is sudden and can be devastating, but many people continue to improve and there is help and support available.

### End Answer

### Question:
What is a CT coronary angiogram?

### Answer:
CT stands for ‘computerised tomography’. A CT scan is a modern, sophisticated type of X-ray.
A CT coronary angiogram shows the blood flow through the coronary arteries. For this test the dye is injected into a small vein in your arm. This makes the test less invasive than a traditional angiogram. 
You will then lie on a bed which passes through a doughnut-shaped opening in a CT scanner to show detailed images of your heart. Some people feel a bit claustrophobic during this test, so let the team know if you feel nervous.
A CT coronary angiogram is generally not as reliable at detecting narrowings in small coronary arteries or in small branches as a traditional coronary angiogram. This means that the standard coronary angiogram is still the ‘gold standard’ for diagnosing coronary heart disease.

### Question:
What is angina ?

### Answer:
Angina is a symptom. It’s a pain or an uncomfortable feeling when blood flow to your heart is reduced. It's not dangerous but it can be a sign of heart problem, like coronary heart disease.

### Question:
How is blood pressure measured?

### Answer:
Your blood pressure is usually measured using a blood pressure monitor. This is usually an electronic monitor connected to an inflatable cuff, which is wrapped around your upper arm.
When you have your blood pressure measured, the reading is written as two numbers. The first is when the pressure is at its highest (or systolic pressure), and the second at its lowest (or diastolic pressure).
For example, your reading might be something like 140/90 mmHg, which you would say as “140 over 90” (mmHg is a unit for measuring blood pressure).
### End Answer

### Question:
Is angina hereditary?

### Answer:
No, angina is not an inherited condition. It won’t be found in a genetic test. But if your grandparents, parents, siblings or children have angina then you have what’s called a strong family history of the condition. This can increase your chance of developing a heart condition that could cause angina too. Find out more about family histories of heart conditions and how you can reduce your risk.

### Question:
What’s heart bypass surgery?

### Answer:
Coronary bypass surgery is a type of surgery where the chest is opened and surgery is performed on the heart. It’s used to bypass – or ‘get around’ - the narrowed or blocked sections of your coronary arteries.
Your surgeon takes a blood vessel (a tube that blood moves through) and attaches it between the aorta (the main blood vessel leaving the heart) and a point along the coronary artery.
In most cases, at least one of the blood vessels used as a bypass graft is an artery from your chest called the internal mammary artery. Blood vessels such as a vein from your legs and sometimes an artery from your arms are used for the other grafts.
You might need one graft, but some people need more. One, two, three and four grafts are often called single, double, triple or quadruple bypasses.

- The right atrium receives the low-oxygen blood that has just travelled round the body. The right atrium pumps the blood to the right ventricle.
- The right ventricle pumps the low-oxygen blood to the lungs to pick up a fresh supply of oxygen.
- The left atrium receives to high-oxygen blood from the lungs and pumps it to the left ventricle.
- The left ventricle pumps the high-oxygen blood to the rest of the body.

### Question:
What are the effects of visceral fat on my health?

### Answer:
Visceral fat affects can:
- raise your blood cholesterol
- increase your blood pressure
- increase your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.
All these risk factors are closely linked with heart and circulatory diseases.
Carrying weight around your middle can make it harder for your body to use a hormone called insulin, which controls your blood glucose (sugar) levels. This can lead to type 2 diabetes. Having high levels of glucose in your bloodstream damages your arteries and increases your risk of heart and circulatory diseases.
People who are ‘apple’ shaped (carry excess weight around their middle) are at higher risk than those who are ‘pear’ shaped (carry weight around their hips, thighs and bottom) because the fat sits around their organs.

### Question:
How do I work out my waist with my height ratio ?

### Answer:
If your BMI is less than 35, it is also recommended that you measure your waist to height ratio, which will also help you work out if you are carrying excess fat around your middle. It’s this type of fat (visceral fat) that increases your health risk.
It’s healthy to keep your waist to less than half your height :
- 0.4 to 0.49 – Healthy
- 0.5 to 0.59 – Increased risk of health problems
- 0.6 or more – Highest risk of health problems

### Question:
What is a stroke?

### Answer:
If the blood flow to the brain is interrupted, brain cells can get damaged because they aren’t getting the oxygen supply they need. A stroke can affect you in different ways, depending on which part of the brain hasn’t received the blood supply. This can affect your speech, as well as the way you think and move.

### Question:
How can I reduce my risk of having a heart attack? 

### Answer:
There are many things you can do to be healthier and reduce your risk, like:
- keeping active – which has been proven to boost energy, sleep and quality of life
- maintaining a healthy weight and diet – this will help your overall health and prevent extra strain on your heart
- limiting how much alcohol you drink (less than the recommended 14 units per week)
- stopping smoking and using other tobacco products
- controlling high blood pressure, cholesterol levels and blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes). 

There are also some risk factors you can't control, such as:
- Family history – if family members have had heart or circulatory disease, you might have a higher risk of getting conditions that can lead to heart attack or stroke.
- Getting older, your ethnic background and your assigned sex at birth all effect your chances of getting a heart condition.
- a previous heart attack.

### End Answer

### Question:
 What's the point of measuring my waist?

### Answer:
You can measure your waist to see whether you’re carrying too much fat around your middle. A larger waist measurement is often a sign that you have too much visceral fat, which can affect your health.
It’s important to note that your waist measurement will not be the same as the measurement you use when shopping for your jeans or trousers.
To measure your waist, place a tape measure around your middle, halfway between the bottom of your ribs and top of your hips, (just above the belly button). 
The recommended waist measurements are:
- below 37 inches (94cm) for men
- below 31.5 inches (80cm) for women.
People with waist sizes bigger than these are more likely to develop certain health problems, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.
Adults from certain ethnic backgrounds, including South Asian, Chinese, other Asian, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean, with waist sizes higher than 90cm for men and 80cm for women are at greater risk of developing the health problems described above.

### Question:
How successful is angioplasty and stenting?

### Answer:
In most cases coronary angioplasty and stenting improves the blood flow through the treated artery. Many people find their symptoms get better and they’re able to do more.
Sometimes the artery can become narrowed again (restenosis), causing angina symptoms. But advances in stent technology mean that the risk of this happening is getting lower. Many people are now symptom-free for a long time.
You can improve your chances of long-term success by making healthy lifestyle changes, including:
- Eating more healthily
- Getting more physically active
- Giving up smoking
- Cutting down on alcohol
- Taking prescribed medicine
A small number of people may have coronary angioplasty complications. The risk varies depending on your overall health and your individual heart condition.
### End Answer

### Question:
How does diabetes increase my risk of heart and circulatory diseases? 

### Answer:
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes cause unused glucose (sugar) to build up in your blood. This can damage the arteries that carry blood, oxygen and nutrients around your body. 
When arteries get damaged, it’s easier for fatty material to stick to the artery walls. This can clog the arteries and reduce the space for blood to flow properly. 
If the arteries carrying blood to your heart get clogged, it can lead to a heart attack. 
If the arteries carrying blood to your brain get clogged, it can lead to a stroke. 
People with diabetes are twice as likely to have a stroke

### Question:
How often should my blood pressure be checked?

### Answer:
If you’re a healthy adult aged 40 to 74, it’s a good idea to get your blood pressure checked every five years (during an NHS Health Check if in England or Wales). If you’re near the threshold for high blood pressure, your healthcare team may ask to monitor you more often.
If your blood pressure is well controlled, you’ll normally be monitored yearly, along with reviewing any medication you take. When you start new medications or have dose changes to existing ones, your blood pressure will need to be checked more than once a year.
Check with your healthcare team how often to measure your blood pressure at home if you have your own monitor. Try keeping a diary of your readings – this will help your healthcare team spot patterns, and it might be motivating to see how your blood pressure improve over time.

### End Answer

### Question:
Do I have to have heart bypass surgery?

### Answer:
If your doctor says you need surgery, talk to them about the treatment options and what the right choice is for you. Heart bypass surgery may not be an option if the arteries around your heart are too narrow or blocked. Instead, your doctor may want to do a coronary angioplasty and stent insertion operation.
A coronary angioplasty is where a special kind of balloon is gently blown up inside the coronary artery to open it up. A stainless steel mesh called a stent is put in the artery to keep it open and let blood flow normally again. The balloon will be taken out.
Before deciding to do an angioplasty, you’ll have an angiogram (type of x-ray) that shows how blocked your arteries are. Your doctor will then know what the best treatment is for you. Before and after your surgery, you may need to take medications to support your heart. In some cases, coronary heart disease can be treated with different medications like:
- antiplatelets – which help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke
- beta blockers – which help reduce the risk of heart conditions like angina and heart attack
- statins - which lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of angina, heart attack and stroke.

### End Answer

### Question:
Are there any Treatments for gestational diabetes?

### Answer:
If you have gestational diabetes, the chances of having problems with your pregnancy can be reduced by controlling your blood sugar levels.
You'll be given a blood sugar testing kit so you can monitor the effects of treatment.
Blood sugar levels may be reduced by changing your diet and being more active if you can. Gentle activities such as walking, swimming and prenatal yoga can help reduce blood sugar. But tell your midwife or doctor before starting an activity you haven’t done before.
However, if these changes don't lower your blood sugar levels enough, you will need to take medicine as well. This may be tablets or insulin injections.
You'll also be more closely monitored during your pregnancy and birth to check for any potential problems.
If you have gestational diabetes, it's best to give birth before 41 weeks. Induction of labour or a caesarean section may be recommended if labour does not start naturally by this time.
Earlier delivery may be recommended if there are concerns about your or your baby's health or if your blood sugar levels have not been well controlled.

### Question:
What counts as high blood pressure?

### Answer:
There are three different stages of high blood pressure:
- Stage one: this is when your blood pressure is between 140/90 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg in the clinic, or 135/85 mmHg to 150/95 mmHg at home.
- Stage two: this is when your blood pressure is between 160/100 mmHg and 180/120 mmHg in the clinic, or over 150/95 mmHg at home.
- Stage three: this is when your systolic blood pressure is over 180 mmHg or your diastolic blood pressure is over 120 mmHg in the clinic. This stage is also called ‘severe hypertension’, and your GP will need to assess you urgently for further investigations.
Discuss your readings with your healthcare team and ask any questions you have. Together, you might want to set a target blood pressure that’s right for you and your health goals.

### Question:
How active do I need to be?

### Answer:
To reduce your risk of heart and circulatory diseases, you need to be active every day. You don’t need to do specific exercises or take up a sport, you can go for a walk, mow the lawn, vacuum, or dance along to music. Any activity is better than none, and you should try to break up long periods of inactivity like sitting or lying down. When you’re watching TV, get up and walk around during the ad breaks.
Aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week. This is anything that raises your heart rate, and makes you breathe faster and feel warmer, like brisk walking or cycling. You can spread out the 150 minutes over the week. You can even do short bursts of activity – every minute counts. You should also aim to do muscle strengthening activities like using hand weights, climbing the stairs, gardening such as digging, or carrying heavy shopping on at least two days a week.

### Question:
What causes your heart and circulatory system to go wrong?

### Answer:
Problems with your heart and circulatory system, including heart attack or a stroke, are usually caused by a gradual build-up of fatty material (called atheroma) in the arteries around the heart and in the arteries that supply blood to your brain.Blocked artery
The fatty material lines the walls of heart's coronary arteries making the space for blood to flow narrower. When the arteries become narrowed and the blood flow is restricted, the arteries can't deliver enough blood to the heart and the brain, which can cause heart and circulatory diseases.

### Question:
How to live with vascular dementia?

### Answer:
Some people diagnosed with vascular dementia are able to live well for many years. However, it's understandable if you feel overwhelmed and worried about how to cope.
On a practical level, there are many things you can do to support yourself, or someone diagnosed with vascular dementia. Some examples include:
- break complex tasks down into small steps
- use reminders, pill boxes or automatic medication dispensers so you don’t forget to take medications
- be aware of the things that make your symptoms worse, like noisy places
- keep to a regular routine and be sure to include activities you enjoy.

Vascular dementia is a progressive condition (this means it gets worse over time), so it’s likely you’ll need further support at some point. People involved in your ongoing care might include:
- healthcare professionals – your GP, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, or a specialist dementia nurse (such as an Admiral Nurse)
- social services – you and your loved ones or carer might be able to access support by having an assessment of your needs
- charities like Dementia UK can offer information, emotional support or advocacy services
- private care and support services, such as paid care workers or your council. Other local organisations may provide meals delivered to your home, if you are eligible.

### Question:
What are the benefits of quitting smoking?

### Answer:
You might notice benefits sooner than you think:
- your heart rate and blood pressure will begin to return to normal after 20 minutes
- your sense of smell and taste will begin to improve after 2-3 days
- your breathing will begin to improve, and exercise may be easier after 2-12 weeks
- your risk of a heart attack is half that of a smoker after 1 year.

Quitting smoking also has other benefits like:
- you will have fresher breath and whiter teeth
- your skin might look younger and age less quickly
- you might have more energy, feel less tired and get less headaches
- your immune system will find it easier to fight off colds and flu
- your sex drive may increase, and it can improve your fertility
- you will protect the health of your children, family and friends.

It’s never too late to benefit from stopping smoking. On average, men will add 10 years to their life if they quit by the age of 30. Many people will add 3 years to their life if they quit by the aged of 60. Being a non-smoker can also improve your chances of being more physically active and healthier as you get older.
### End Answer

### Question:
Am I at risk of getting atherosclerosis?

### Answer:
Since there isn’t a specific reason why arteries become narrowed or blocked by atheroma, anyone is at risk of getting atherosclerosis. However, there are some factors that can increase your chances of getting it, such as:
- a family history of atherosclerosis or other heart problems
- being overweight or obese
- conditions like high cholesterol, diabetes or high blood pressure (which increase your risk of having heart and circulatory diseases)
- drinking too much alcohol (more than the recommend weekly amount of 14 units)
- ethnicity - research has shown that people of some ethnicities (Black Africans, African Caribbean's and South Asians) in the UK are at higher risk of developing high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes. Both of these conditions increase your risk of having heart and circulatory disease
- getting older, especially if you're over 65
- not exercising enough
- smoking and using other tobacco products
- unhealthy diet.

### Question:
What is vascular dementia?

### Answer:
Dementia is a word used to describe a set of mental (the mind) and neurological (the brain) symptoms which worsen over time, such as memory loss and difficulty concentrating. It mostly affects people who are over the age of 65.
Vascular dementia is a condition caused by poor blood flow in the brain, resulting in symptoms like memory loss, confusion, and thinking difficulties. There’s no cure, but treatment may slow its progression.
Vascular dementia is a specific type of dementia. It is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease.
Like other types of dementia, vascular dementia doesn't have any known cure. Although it's sometimes possible to slow down the development of symptoms, unfortunately they will get worse as the brain loses more and more of it functioning.

### Question:
What increases my chance of having a stroke?

### Answer:
A risk factor increases your chance of developing a condition. Risk factors for a stroke are similar to those for heart diseases, such as angina or heart attacks. 
There are many things you can do to help lower your chances of a stroke: 
- eat healthily 
- be physically active 
- keep to a healthy weight and lose weight if necessary
- don't smoke
- cut down on alcohol
- control high blood pressure 
- control high cholesterol
- control blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes).
If you have an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF) your risk of stroke is increased. This is because AF increases the risk of a blood clot forming inside the top chambers of your heart. If this happens, it can travel to your brain and block the blood flow to your brain. 
### End Answer

### Question:
 What are the types?

### Answer:
Cholesterol is used by all the cells in your body to keep them healthy. It is carried around your body to the cells that need it by proteins in your blood. Proteins are substances in your body that do most of the work in your cells and help keep your body’s tissues and organs working as they should.
When cholesterol and proteins combine, they're called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoproteins. One is good for your health; the other is bad.
High-density lipoproteins or HDL is known as ‘good’ cholesterol. It gets rid of the ‘bad’ cholesterol from your blood by taking cholesterol you don’t need back to the liver, where it is broken down and removed from your body.
Non-high-density lipoproteins or non-HDL is known as 'bad' cholesterol. Too much non-HDL leads to a build up of fatty deposits inside the walls of the blood vessels (channels that carry blood throughout your body). This builds up and narrows blood vessels, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke. 
You may also have heard 'bad' cholesterol being called 'LDL' cholesterol. This used to be the main measure of harmful types of cholesterol, but we now know that other forms of non-HDL cholesterol can also affect your health.
### End Answer

### Question:
How is vascular dementia linked to atrial fibrillation and stroke?

### Answer:
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heart rhythm which increases your risk of stroke.
AF can cause a blood clot to form in one of the top chambers of your heart. This can be pumped out of your heart to your brain where it can cause a stroke.
As vascular dementia often develops after a stroke, people with AF are at higher risk.

How is atherosclerosis treated?

### Answer:
If you’re diagnosed with atherosclerosis, there aren’t any treatments that can get rid of it. You'll have it for the rest of your life. However, there are medicines and treatments that can slow down its progress, reduce your symptoms and let you live your normal life.
Your doctor will talk you about what treatment you might need, which may include:
- a procedure – if your arteries are seriously narrowed or blocked, coronary bypass surgery or a coronary angioplasty may have to be done
- changes to your lifestyle – like exercising, not smoking and drinking less alcohol to reduce symptoms
- changes to your diet – to reduce the effects of conditions like high cholesterol, high blood pressure or diabetes
- medicines – to reduce high cholesterol, high blood pressure or the risk of blood clots.
Living with atherosclerosis for the rest of your life can be scary and stressful. Although it can be hard, you can reduce any negative feelings you might have by talking to family, friends and asking your GP any questions you may have.

### Question:
How can I get a cholesterol test?

### Answer:
You can ask your doctor to check your cholesterol levels, which are measured using a simple blood test. It is sometimes referred to as a ‘lipid profile’. Your GP or practice nurse will take a blood sample, to check for the following:
- evels of good cholesterol (HDL)
- evels of bad cholesterol (non-HDL)
- riglycerides.
You will also get a total cholesterol result. 
You may be offered a finger-prick cholesterol test. This can be done in some pharmacies, or as part of the NHS Health Check in England.
Cholesterol levels vary from person to person, but in general, for a healthy heart you need a low level of non-HDL level and a higher level of HDL.

How is atherosclerosis diagnosed?

### Answer:
To find out if you have atherosclerosis, your doctor will ask questions about your lifestyle, family history and may send you for tests. If you can, find out if you have a family history of atherosclerosis or heart disease so your doctor gets a full picture. The tests may include:
- blood tests - to check your cholesterol and overall health
- carotid ultrasound – a test that makes pictures of the insides of the two largest arteries in your neck (called the carotid arteries)
- CT scan/coronary calcium scoring – a scan of the heart to see how much plaque has built up in the arteries of your heart
- coronary angiogram – a special x-ray using dye to see the blood flow in your heart
- ECG – a test that records the electrical activity of your heart
- exercise ECG - a test that records the electrical activity of your heart while you’re exercising.

What are the Symptoms of a heart attack ?

### Answer:
Heart attack symptoms vary from person to person. They can include:
- pain or discomfort in your chest that happens suddenly and doesn't go away
- pain that spreads to your left or right arm, or to your neck, jaw, back or stomach. For some people the pain or tightness is severe, while for others it’s uncomfortable. It may feel like heaviness, or a burning pain similar to indigestion
- feeling sick, sweaty, light-headed or short of breath.
Other less common symptoms include:
- a sudden feeling of anxiety that can feel similar to a panic attack
- lots of coughing or wheezing due to a build-up of fluid in the lungs.
It’s possible to have a heart attack without experiencing all these symptoms, and it’s important to remember everyone experiences pain differently. This is more likely in elderly people or people with diabetes, as the condition can cause nerve damage which affects how you feel pain.

How can I quit smoking?

### Answer:
If you quit smoking, you will greatly improve your health and the health of everyone around you. It may feel hard to resist the temptation to smoke sometimes. But you can make small changes to make it easier to stick to it:
- Try to think positively – even if you’ve tried to quit before and didn’t manage it, don’t let it put you off trying again.
- Set a date to quit and tell your family, friends and colleagues so they can help you stick to it.
- Plan how you will deal with your cravings when you’re at events and times where you would usually smoke.
- If you usually smoke after meals, eat foods that can make cigarettes taste bad like cheese, fruit and vegetables. Or change your routine to keep your mind busy when you would usually smoke, like washing the dishes straight after eating.
- Cravings usually last around 5 minutes. Plan things you can do in 5 minutes to stay busy for when you get cravings.
- When you’re out, hold your drink with the hand that used to hold cigarettes and use a straw. This will help to keep your hands and mouth busy.
- When you get a craving, remind yourself of why you’re quitting. You may want to carry a picture of your family with you to look at if you’re tempted to smoke.
You are not alone. Aside from your family and friends, you can get support from healthcare professionals, stop smoking programmes and nicotine replacement therapy.

### Question:
What is the structure of the human heart?

### Answer:
Your heart has a left side and a right side, they are separated by a thin muscular wall called the Septum. Both sides of your heart have an upper chamber and a lower chamber.

- the upper chambers are called the left atrium and the right atrium (or the atria)
- the lower chambers are called the left ventricle and the right ventricle.

The right side of your heart receives the de-oxygenated blood that has just travelled round your body. It pumps the blood to your lungs to collect a fresh supply of oxygen. The left side of your heart pumps the re-oxygenated blood round your body again.

Your heart muscle is made up of three layers of tissue:
- Pericardium : a thin, outer lining that protects and surrounds your heart.
- Myocardium : a thick, muscular middle layer that contracts and relaxes to pump blood around of your heart.
- Endocardium : a thin, inner layer that makes up the lining of the four chambers and the valves in your heart.

### Question:
What are the different types of stroke?

### Answer:
- Ischaemic strokes happen when an artery supplying blood to your brain is blocked by a blood clot.
- Haemorrhagic strokes happen when a blood vessel ruptures (or bursts), causing a bleed in the brain. This means less blood gets to the surrounding brain cells causing them to die.
- Mini-strokes, or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), happen when there’s an interruption in blood flow to part of the brain for a short time causing symptoms, such as temporary speech loss. TIA’s usually resolve after a few seconds or minutes.
If you think someone is having any of these symptoms you should call 18 immediately.

### Question:
How is a stroke treated in hospital?

### Answer:
As soon as possible, you’ll be taken for a brain scan. If you've had a stroke, you'll be closely monitored and depending on the type of stroke you may be given clot-busting medication (known as thrombolysis). The amount of time you stay in hospital depends on the type and severity of your stroke, your treatment, your general health and how quickly you recover.
It’s common to feel anxious, angry and upset  after having a stroke. Talk to your healthcare professionals and let them know if you want them to repeat anything. You can also ask for help and if you do they will discuss with you and your family if they feel think you’ll need support when you go home.
The Stroke Association has more detailed information on what happens to people with a stroke in hospital, including tests and treatment.

### Question:
How does diet and exercise affect diabetes? 

### Answer:
If you are diabetic, eating a balanced diet and limiting certain foods is important. Your doctor will usually advise you to: 
- Eat a range of foods including fruit, vegetables and starchy foods like pasta. 
- Eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day – skipping meals can cause your blood sugar levels to go too low. 
- Reduce the amount of high-sugar, high-fat and high-salt foods and drinks you have.
Being physically active is another great way to control your blood sugar levels. Exercise helps to lower the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood because your muscles need to use more of it. This can reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases and other complications. Physical activity can also boost your mood; help you feel less tired, and it can be fun too. 
Adults in the UK are recommended to get around two and a half hours of exercise a week. As long as you’re doing something to get you out of breath, it can be anything: 
- swimming 
- riding a bike 
- brisk walking with your dog 
- playing with a frisbee in the park 
- pushing a lawn mower or hoovering. 
If you are diabetic, it is important to manage your blood pressure and cholesterol level to reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases. And having a healthy weight is the best way to manage your blood pressure, cholesterol level and diabetes. 
People living with excess weight or obesity and diabetes will usually be advised by their doctor to make small lifestyle changes to have a healthy weight. If you are worried about your weight, you can visit your local GP service for weight loss advice and support.

What are the symptoms of coronary heart disease?

### Answer:
Coronary heart disease (CHD) develops slowly over time and the symptoms can be different for everyone. Some people don't know they have CHD before they have a heart attack. 
Angina is the term used to describe the most common symptoms of CHD. These include: 
- chest pain
- shortness of breath
- pain travelling through the body
- feeling faint
- nausea

### Question:
What is an angiogram?

### Answer:
An angiogram (also known as a cardiac catheterisation) is a special type of x-ray which uses contrast dye to allow your doctor to look at your coronary arteries (the blood vessels that supply your heart).
The dye lets your doctor see how well the blood is flowing and shows up any narrowings.
Depending on your results, the procedure can help your doctor decide what treatment you might need.
An angiogram can sometimes also be helpful for investigating other conditions, such as congenital heart disease.

### Question:
What does the heart's electrical system do?

### Answer:
Your heart's electrical system tells your heart when to contract and when to relax to keep your blood pumping regularly. The instructions to contract and relax are carried by electrical signals.
The electrical signals are sent from the sinus node which is known as your heart's natural pacemaker. Usually, the sinus node will send the electrical signals at a steady pace, but the pace can change depending on your emotions and if you are active or resting : this is your heart rate.

### Question:
Is second-hand smoke harmful?

### Answer:
Yes, second-hand smoke is harmful. Second-hand smoke (also known as passive smoke) is when you breathe in the smoke in the air from someone else’s cigarette and the smoke they breathe out.
When the people around you breathe in your cigarette smoke, it increases their risk of developing:
- breathing problems
- cancers like lung cancer
- heart and circulatory diseases like strokes and heart attacks.

Second-hand smoke is very dangerous for children. They are 3 times more likely to get lung cancer in later life than children who live with non-smokers. Children who live in a home with smokers can have double the risk of getting illnesses like:
- pneumonia
- ear infections
- wheezing and asthma.
You can help to protect your loved ones, friends and colleagues from the dangers of second-hand smoke by quitting.

### Question:
What happens during an angioplasty?

### Answer:
An angioplasty normally takes between 30 minutes and two hours, although it can take longer in some cases. You’ll usually be awake during the procedure.
- You’ll be asked not to eat or drink for four to six hours before the angioplasty
- You'll change into your gown and will be asked to remove any jewellery that might get in the way.
- You will usually be awake and lying on your back for the angioplasty. You may be given a sedative to help you relax – talk to your doctor about this if you are nervous.
- You’ll be given a local anaesthetic injection in your wrist or groin. A thin tube (the catheter) is then passed into your artery through the numbed area.
- A special dye (called a contrast dye) is injected into the tube so that your coronary arteries can be seen on an x-ray screen. This part is called an angiogram. It’s normal to feel a flushing sensation when the dye enters your bloodstream – for some people, this might feel as though they are weeing themselves.
- During your procedure, you’ll be attached to a heart monitor that records your heart rate and rhythm and you’ll have a clip measuring your oxygen levels on your finger. You’ll also have your blood pressure checked regularly.
- Many people experience a feeling of pressure during the angioplasty. If you feel unwell, or have chest pain at any time, tell the team.
- After the procedure, the thin tube is removed and there may be a small amount of bleeding when it is taken out.
- You’ll then come back to the recovery room where you’ll be monitored by nurses.
- If you had the tube put into your wrist, you’ll be sat upright and if everything is okay, could be ready to leave the hospital as little as two hours later.
- If you had the tube put into your groin, you’ll need to lie on your back at first and stay longer recovering in hospital, around five to six hours.
- If you’ve come in for an emergency angioplasty – for example, following a heart attack – you may be kept overnight.
Your angioplasty and stent procedure will take place in a cath lab – a sterile room in the hospital that looks like an operation room.

### Question:
What are the risks of coronary angioplasty and stents?

### Answer:
All types of medical procedures come with risk. With angioplasty and stenting, common complications can include:
- bleeding, bruising, or an infection where the catheter tube is put into the body (in the wrist or groin)
- blood clots – these can form within stents even after the procedure, so it’s important to take any prescribed medicine such as aspirin and anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel

The risk of major complications during an angioplasty is usually less than one percent. Rare risks of angioplasty and stenting include:
- complications after or during the procedure, such as a heart attack or stroke
- an allergic reaction to the contrast dye used during the procedure
- very rarely damage to the coronary artery during the procedure
If you’re worried or have more questions, we encourage you to ask your doctor. They’ll be able to answer any questions specific to you and your procedure. You can also download or order our in-depth guide on having coronary angioplasty.

### Question:
What causes angina? 

### Answer:
The most common cause is coronary heart disease. This is when the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood and oxygen are narrowed by a fatty substance called plaque. It means less blood flows to your heart muscle and can cause angina symptoms. 
There are common triggers for angina pain, like:
- physical activity
- emotional stress
- cold weather
- eating a meal.
Panic attacks or feeling anxious can cause chest pain . If you experience this, it isn’t angina. Anxiety isn’t caused by a problem with your blood flow, whereas angina is.

### Question:
Why should I warm up and cool down?

### Answer:
It’s easy to skip if you’re tired or in a rush but warming up and cooling down is important to staying safe and getting the most out of your workout. Warming up and cooling down helps by:
- getting you in the right mood to exercise
- preparing your body by raising your heart rate slowly, so there isn't a sudden increase in workload for your heart
- sending blood to the active areas of your body
- stretching to keep your muscles from shortening and increasing flexibility
- warming up your muscles and preparing the joints for movement.
If you have a heart condition, a warmup should last at least 15 minutes and a cool down should last at least 10 minutes. Older adults may need 15 - 20 minutes.

### Question:
What is the function of the human heart?

### Answer:
Each day, your heart beats around 100,000 times. This continuously pumps about five litres (eight pints) of blood around your body through a network of blood vessels called your circulatory system. This blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to all parts of your body to help your organs and muscles work properly. Your blood also carries away unwanted carbon dioxide and waste products.

### Question:
What are the symptoms of gestational diabetes?

### Answer:
Gestational diabetes does not usually cause any symptoms. Most cases are only discovered when your blood sugar levels are tested during screening for gestational diabetes.
Some women may develop symptoms if their blood sugar levels gets too high (hyperglycaemia), such as:
- increased thirst
- needing to pee more often than usual
- a dry mouth
- tiredness
- blurred eyesight
- genital itching or thrush
But some of these symptoms are common during pregnancy and are not necessarily a sign of gestational diabetes. Speak to your midwife or doctor if you're worried about any symptoms you're experiencing.

### Question:
How is diabetes treated? 

### Answer:
The treatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be slightly different. 
Eating a healthy balanced diet and being physically active are recommended to support the treatment for both types, especially type 2. This is because type 2 diabetes is linked to having excess weight or obesity. But it can also help you sleep better and feel more energised. 
The treatment for type 1 diabetes is insulin injections multiple times a day, regular exercise and a healthy balanced diet. 
People with type 1 diabetes can’t make insulin because their body attacks the cells that make it. This means their body needs to be given insulin to control their blood sugar levels. And they will need to monitor their blood sugar levels multiple times a day. 
There are different types of insulin injections. If you have type 1 diabetes, your doctor will explain the types of insulin you need, how often you need them and how to check your blood sugar levels. 
The treatment for type 2 diabetes is usually medication and a keen focus on regular exercise and a healthy balanced diet. 
Most people need medicine to control their type 2 diabetes. The medicine helps to lower the amount of sugar in your blood. This can reduce the risk of developing other health problems like heart and circulatory diseases. 
Sometimes, people with type 2 diabetes might need insulin injections. And, their doctor might ask them to check their blood sugar levels regularly. But most type 2 diabetics don’t have to. 
The type of medication, the amount you take and if you need insulin injections might change over time. You will have regular check-ups with your doctor to review your treatment plan. 
Some people with type 2 diabetes may be able to stop taking medication if they can control their blood sugar levels with a healthy balanced diet, regular exercise and by losing weight.

### Question:
what are the symptoms of High cholesterol?

### Answer:
There are usually no symptoms of high cholesterol. But if left untreated, it can lead to heart attack and stroke.
It's often a hidden risk factor which means it can happen without us knowing until it's too late. That is why it's so important to get your cholesterol level checked.
However, if you have familial hypercholesterolaemia, you may have visible signs of high cholesterol. These include:
- Tendon xanthomata - swellings made from cholesterol on the knuckles of your hands, your knees or the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle.
- Xanthelasmas - small, yellow lumps of cholesterol near the inner corner of your eye.
- Corneal arcus - this is a pale white ring around the coloured part of your eye, your iris.

### Question:
Can you have sex after stents in your heart?

### Answer:
It is normal to feel anxious about having sex if you have a heart condition. But there is no reason why you can’t continue to enjoy a healthy sex life, once you have recovered from having an angioplasty and stent fitted.
In fact, some people who were previously affected by angina, find they are able to have a more active sex life as they have more energy after an angioplasty and stent.
Your doctor will have talked to lots of other people about sex. You won’t be the first or the last person to ask. It may not be easy to talk about at first, but most people say they feel a lot better afterwards and are glad they did.

### Question:
What are the signs of a stroke?

### Answer:
Act F.A.S.T to recognise the signs:
- Facial weakness – can they smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped?
- Arm weakness – can they raise both arms?
- Speech problems – can they speak clearly and can they understand what you're saying?
- Time – it's time to call 18 immediately if you see any of these symptoms.
It’s called F.A.S.T because timing is critical if you're having a stroke. You could lose millions of nerve cells for every minute without treatment. The longer you wait, the less chance of speech, movement and abilities being returned to what they were. Acting F.A.S.T really is lifesaving. Read more here.

### End Answer

### Question:
What causes a heart attack?

### Answer:
Most heart attacks are caused by coronary heart disease (CHD).
CHD causes your coronary arteries to become narrowed by a gradual build-up of fatty deposits called atheroma. 
If a piece of atheroma breaks off, a blood clot forms around this to try and repair the damage to the artery wall. This clot can block your coronary artery, causing your heart muscle to be starved of blood and oxygen.
Other less common causes of a heart attack include:
- spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) which is when a tear appears in the wall of one of your coronary arteries
- using harmful drugs like cocaine and amphetamines (speed)
- hypoxia (a sudden drop in oxygen levels in the body).
Although symptoms can vary from person to person, women and men generally experience the same heart attack symptoms. However, research shows women tend to not recognise the symptoms as a sign of a heart attack as quickly. This is mainly because heart attacks are wrongly believed to be a “man’s problem."

How is high blood pressure treated?

### Answer:
How your high blood pressure is managed depends on a range of things, such as your health goals and the stage of your condition. The healthcare team at your GP practice will help you create a plan to reduce your blood pressure.
By making lifestyle changes, you can lower your blood pressure and keep it at a healthy level. Recent evidence shows that tackling obesity and staying active are especially important. You'll feel the benefits right away with improved sleep, more energy, and a better mood. This useful tool developed by the NHS helps you make a plan that you can discuss with your GP.
If your blood pressure is high or very high, your GP will usually offer you medicines on top of lifestyle changes.
### End Answer

### Question:
What causes high cholesterol?

### Answer:
Anyone can develop high cholesterol. It can be caused by many different things; some you can control, and others you can’t.
Things that cause high cholesterol which you can control:
Your lifestyle:
- eating too much saturated fat – this reduces the liver’s ability to remove cholesterol, so it builds up in the blood
- being physically inactive – being active raises the level of ‘good’ cholesterol and reduces the level of ‘bad’ cholesterol
- smoking - this can lead to high cholesterol levels and it causes tar to build up in your arteries, making it easier for cholesterol to stick to your artery walls.

Things that cause high cholesterol which you can't control:
- Your age, biological sex and ethnic background:
- getting older – having higher cholesterol is more likely as we age
- if your biological sex is male (you were assigned male at birth) – males are more likely to have high cholesterol
- your ethnic background – if you are from a south Asian background, you are more likely to have high cholesterol.

Your genes:
Genes carry the information that determines your features or characteristics that are passed on to you — or inherited — from your parents. Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), is an inherited condition, meaning you were born with it. It is often passed down through families in faulty genes and can lead to very high levels of cholesterol, even if you don’t have other risk factors.

Your general health:
- kidney disease - when your kidneys aren’t working well, it also changes the way your body handles cholesterol, which can lead to high cholesterol
- liver disease – an important job of the liver is to both produce cholesterol and clear it from the body, but if the liver isn’t working well it struggles to do this, increasing your risk of high cholesterol
- if you live with excess weight, especially around your middle
- if you have type 2 diabetes, you are at greater risk of having high cholesterol
- having an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism – when your body doesn’t make enough thyroid hormone)
- growth hormone deficiency (when not enough of the growth hormone is made). 
### End Answer

### Question:
How much exercise should I do?

### Answer:
It’s recommended that you do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week. Moderate exercise is when you feel warm and comfortably breathless like when walking or pushing a lawn mower. Intense exercise is when you breathe hard and fast like when running, swimming or cycling.
What one person finds moderate may be intense to another. That’s why it’s helpful to do the ‘talk test’ while you’re exercising to find the right level for you. The talk test:
- if you can comfortably talk while being active
- feel warm and are breathing a little more heavily than normal
- you're moving at the right pace.

Whether it’s walking or weights, it’s important to start low and slow and to ‘listen’ to your body. A session could be as little as five or 10 minutes. Even the smallest changes can have great results.
It’s best to spread your exercise evenly over the week, making sure you have some rest days to ensure your body recovers. Recovery can be just as important for improving your fitness as the exercise itself. Being active is about living a happier, healthier life and should fit into it how you live.

Is Smokeless tobacco harmful for my health?

### Answer:
Smokeless tobacco is not safer than smoking cigarettes. It’s a type of tobacco that can either be chewed, sucked, or inhaled without producing smoke.
Most smokeless tobaccos have the same amount of nicotine as cigarettes. They can also have more than 25 chemicals that are known to cause cancer. Using smokeless tobacco can also increase your risk of having:
- complicated pregnancies
- mouth and tooth problems
- heart and circulatory diseases.
### End Answer

### Question:
What is blood pressure?

### Answer:
Blood pressure is the pressure of blood in your arteries. Your arteries are the vessels (tubes) that carry blood from your heart to your brain and the rest of your body. You need a certain amount of pressure to get the blood moving around your body.
Your blood pressure naturally goes up and down throughout the day and night, and it’s normal for it to go up while you’re moving about. It’s when your overall blood pressure is always high, even when you are resting, that you need to do something about it.
Blood pressure is measured using two numbers:
- Systolic pressure: this is the higher of the two numbers. It’s the pressure against your arteries when your heart is pumping blood around your body.
- Diastolic pressure: this is the lower of the two numbers. It shows how much pressure is in your arteries when your heart relaxes between beats.
### End Answer

### Question:
What causes an inherited heart condition? 

### Answer:
Your body is made up of trillions of cells. Each cell has a nucleus, containing information that makes you unique. This information is called your genes. We all have between 20,000 and 25,000 different genes each.
Genes affect how we look and how our bodies work, and we inherit them from our parents. Inherited heart conditions are caused by a fault (or mutation) in one or more of our genes. If one of your parents has a faulty gene, there’s a 50:50 chance you could have it too. If you do, then there’s also a 50:50 chance you could pass it on to your children.
It’s possible to have a faulty gene that can lead to a heart condition, but you may never develop any signs or symptoms of the condition itself. If this happens, you can still pass the faulty gene onto your child and there’s no way of knowing how it may affect them.
### End Answer

### Question:
What is diabetes?

### Answer:
Diabetes is a life-long condition that causes your blood sugar levels to become too high. 
Sugar in the blood is also known as glucose, it’s your body’s main source of energy. It comes from the food you eat, particularly carbohydrates like bread and potatoes. 
Glucose is carried through the bloodstream to cells around the body to give them energy to work. When there’s glucose in the bloodstream, the pancreas (an organ near the stomach) makes a hormone (a chemical messenger) called insulin. Insulin tells the body’s cells to absorb the glucose and use it as energy. 
In somebody with diabetes, their body can’t absorb glucose because there is a problem with their insulin. This means: 
- their cells don’t use the glucose for energy 
- the unused glucose stays in their blood and builds up 
- the excess glucose can damage their arteries (arteries carry oxygen-rich blood and nutrients around the body) 
- if their arteries are damaged, it can increase their risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases. 
### End Answer

### Question:
Why should I be more active?

### Answer:
The heart is a muscle, and like any other muscle it needs physical activity or exercise to help it work properly. When you’re active, your lungs do a better job of getting oxygen into your blood so it can be pumped to all the tissues and cells of your body.
Being active can reduce your risk of developing some heart and circulatory diseases by as much as 35%. Regular physical activity:
- helps control your blood pressure and keep it within healthy levels
- raises your levels of good cholesterol, and reduces the bad cholesterol
- can help to control your blood glucose levels, reducing your risk of Type 2 diabetes
- increases the number of calories you burn and helps you maintain a healthy weight.
Not only does regular activity protect your heart, it can also help your general wellbeing by boosting your mood, improving your concentration and memory, and helping you sleep better.

### Question:
What happens during an angiogram?

### Answer:
The test is done in a cardiac catheter laboratory or ‘cath lab’. You can expect the test to last around half an hour, although it can sometimes take longer. You will need to lie flat for the procedure.
- You will be asked not to eat or drink anything for a few hours before your procedure.
- You’ll be given a local anaesthetic injection in the wrist or groin. The catheter (a thin, flexible tube) will then be passed into an artery.
- The catheter will be directed through your blood vessels and up to your heart. The doctors will use X-ray to help guide them to the arteries.
- A special dye called contrast will then be passed through the catheter and a series of images will be taken. It is very common to feel a hot, flushing sensation as the dye enters your bloodstream, but this is completely normal and only lasts for a few seconds. The dye will show up any narrowed areas or blockages in the artery on the X-ray.
- During your procedure, you’ll be attached to a heart monitor that records your heart rate and rhythm and you’ll have a probe measuring your oxygen levels on your finger. If you feel unwell or uncomfortable at any time, you should tell a member of the hospital staff.

### Question:
What causes diabetes? 

### Answer:
The cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Scientists understand type 1 diabetes causes the body to attack the cells that make insulin. Research is happening to understand why that is. 
The cause of type 2 diabetes is a problem with the amount of insulin being made or used. The body can’t control its blood sugar levels so they keep rising. It’s often linked to: 
- being physically inactive 
- having excess weight or obesity 
- having a family history of type 2 diabetes 
- having pre-diabetes – when your blood sugar levels are above the normal range but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. 
It usually develops gradually and affects more adults over the age of 40. But it can develop at any age. And if you have a South Asian, African Caribbean or Black Asian background, you might have an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. 
### End Answer

### Question:
How does blood flow around the heart and the body?

### Answer:
Your heart is linked to the rest of the circulatory system with blood vessels called arteries and veins.

- your arteries deliver oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other areas of your body
- your veins return the de-oxygenated blood from your organs back to your heart
- your arteries and veins are connected by even smaller blood vessels called capillaries.
Your blood flows around your heart and the rest of your body in one direction, like a one-way traffic system. Your heart valves control the direction of your blood flow, they act like doors that open and close with every heartbeat. There are four valves in your heart, they are:

the tricuspid valve and the pulmonary valve on the right side of the heart
the mitral valve and the aortic valve on the left side of your heart.
Like the rest of your body, your heart needs to be supplied with oxygen-rich blood to work properly too. The coronary arteries are the arteries responsible for supplying the heart with oxygenated blood. The coronary arteries are spread across the outside of the heart to deliver the blood.

### Question:
Are there any Long-term effects of gestational diabetes?

### Answer:
Gestational diabetes normally goes away after birth. But women who've had it are more likely to develop:
- gestational diabetes again in future pregnancies
- type 2 diabetes – a lifelong type of diabetes

You should have a blood test to check for diabetes 6 to 13 weeks after giving birth, and once every year after that if the result is normal.
See your GP if you develop symptoms of high blood sugar, such as increased thirst, needing to pee more often than usual, and a dry mouth – do not wait until your next test. 
You should have the tests even if you feel well, as many people with diabetes do not have any symptoms.
You'll also be advised about things you can do to reduce your risk of getting diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly.
Some research has suggested that babies of mothers who had gestational diabetes may be more likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life.

- less common symptoms like feeling sick, sweaty, dizzy and breathless
- microvascular angina – spasms in the smallest coronary arteries.

### Question:
How long after a stent can you drive?

### Answer:
You shouldn’t drive for at least a week after having an angioplasty and stent - longer if you also had a heart attack.
Check with your doctor to see how soon you can drive after having a heart attack and stent. You may need to wait up to four weeks.
If you drive a heavy vehicle for a living, such as a lorry or a bus, you must tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) that you've had a coronary angioplasty. They'll arrange further testing before you can return to work.

### Question:
How is the recovering from a heart attack at home?

### Answer:
When you get home, it’s a good idea to gradually build up how much you do. Even if you don’t feel like it, many people find getting up, washing and dressing a positive first step.
Over time, you can do some light household activities like making a hot drink or get back into the habit of doing the usual things like the washing up. Walking around the house or standing up from the chair and marching on the spot for a minute is another way of keeping active.
You might find it helpful to have someone stay with you for the first few days or weeks once you return home. If it’s not safe for you to be discharged from the hospital on your own, you may be able to stay longer.
You can speak to your team about going home as soon as possible and they can help you get support like a small, temporary package of care or special equipment at home if you need it. Learn more about care after being discharged from hospital.
A heart attack can be a frightening experience and it can take time to come to terms with what's happened. It’s natural to be worried about your recovery, feel scared, frustrated and isolated. For support and advice, visit our emotional support page.

### Question:
What is Microvascular angina?

### Answer:
Microvascular angina (also known as cardiac syndrome X) usually happens when you're under physical pressure, like when you're exercising, or you’ve been stressed or anxious. The pain is often caused by spasms in the smallest coronary arteries restricting blood flow.

### Question:
What is physical inactivity?

### Answer:
Physical inactivity or being sedentary is when you don’t move your body for long periods of time. This can include sitting or lying on the sofa watching TV, and sitting at a desk or computer. Being physically active doesn’t mean you need to join a gym or run a marathon. It can include things like housework and gardening – it’s all about getting up and moving more.

### Question:
What medications will I have to take after a heart attack?

### Answer:
It’s essential that you take any medication that’s been prescribed even if you feel well. Medications may include:
- Antiplatelets like clopidogrel or ticagrelor are commonly prescribed for one year to reduce the chance of you having another heart attack. Most people are also prescribed lifelong aspirin.
- ACE inhibitors or ARBs such as ramipril or losartan are prescribed to treat heart failure and high blood pressure.
- Beta blockers like bisoprolol help control your heart rate and can also help lower blood pressure. This helps to reduce the workload of the heart so that it can recover.
- Statins like atorvastatin reduce the level of cholesterol in your blood and protect the insides of your arteries.
- Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray helps reduce chest pain which can happen after a heart attack.
If you have any questions, concerns or are worried about side effects from your medication, don’t stop taking it and talk to your doctor. If your symptoms are serious, speak to your GP or pharmacist straight away.
If you notice some side effects but they’re not too bad, it can help to keep a diary of your symptoms before you talk to your doctor so they can help you manage. Another option is to use the New Medicine Service (NMS) through the NHS to get extra help and advice if you’re prescribed medicine to treat a long-term condition.

### Question:
How do I work out my BMI?

### Answer:
The first step to calculating your BMI is to measure your height and weight. Your GP or practice nurse can do this for you if you can’t do this at home.
Using your height and your weight, you’ll be able to work out your BMI using this formula: weight / (height * height)
Your BMI score will place you into one of these categories:
- Underweight: BMI below 18.5
- healthy weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
- overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9
- obesity class 1: BMI 30 to 34.9
- obesity class 2: BMI 35 to 39.9
- obesity class 3: BMI 40 or more
As BMI doesn’t take muscle mass into account, you may find yourself in the overweight or obese category if you’re muscular.

### Question:
What causes obesity or weight gain?

### Answer:
The causes of obesity include many things such as:
- portion sizes
- medical conditions and medications
- our genes
- stress and lack of sleep
- junk food advertising
- food labelling
- the fat and sugar content of every day foods
- the calorie content of food and drink served in restaurants and cafes

managing your weight can be difficult. A good place to start is to know about calories. The amount of energy in food or drink is measured in kilocalories (kcal), you may hear them called calories. You bring energy (calories) into your body by eating and you burn calories by being active. When you eat and drink more calories than you use up, your body keeps the excess calories as body fat. If you regularly eat more calories than you use up, you will start to gain weight. 
If you're concerned about your weight and you would like help to start managing it, you can speak to your GP.

### Question:
What happens after heart bypass surgery?

### Answer:
After your operation, you’ll be moved to intensive care or a specialist recovery department. This is where people who need special monitoring after surgery go so a close eye can be kept on them.
When your doctor decides that you don’t need intensive care anymore, you’ll be moved to the cardiac ward or the high dependency unit which is for people who need a higher level of care than normal.
After that, you can begin your recovery. You should generally be able to sit in a chair after one day, walk after three days and use stairs after five or six days. When you go home, you’ll need to relax for a few weeks.
You should be able to do most of your normal activities after about six weeks, including working, driving and sex. If you have a heavy manual job, you may need to rest for longer.
In many hospitals, after a heart bypass operation, a member of the cardiac specialist team will see you on the ward to give you information about your condition and the treatment you’ve had.
They’ll talk to you about making lifestyle changes and how to reduce your risk factors (the things that increase your risk of heart disease) to help protect your heart in the future. They’ll offer you cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) to get you fit and strong again too.
It’s okay to feel low after surgery and the team can help you if you want to talk with them. Many people say their time in hospital becomes a blur. You may find it helpful to write down or have someone with you to help remember the information you get throughout your journey.
It's important to look after your heart health long term so you don’t develop more heart problems. You can do this by making lifestyle changes such as:
- avoiding or drinking less alcohol (no more than the recommended limit of 14 units a week)
- eating healthier foods
- not smoking or using tobacco products
- staying active.
Living a healthier lifestyle can be hard at first, but it’s important for your overall quality of life. Visit our healthy living hub to read about how you can start to eat healthier and manage things like smoking and stress today. You can also ask your doctor or nurse any questions about your recovery.

### Question:
Is chest pain normal after a stent placement?

### Answer:
It is possible that you are experiencing discomfort because the stent is taking time to settle. This is quite normal, but you may want to make an appointment to see your GP and check if they want to review medications.
A stent will help blood flow in the artery where it has been fitted and will usually improve symptoms of angina. But sometimes other heart arteries can be narrowed too, so you may still have some angina symptoms.
If you get chest pain, stop and rest, and take your GTN if you've been prescribed it. The pain should go away within five minutes. If it doesn’t, take your GTN again.
If the pain hasn’t gone away within five minutes of taking the second dose of GTN, call 999 immediately. You could be having a heart attack.

### Question:
How do I prepare for exercise?

### Answer:
Setting yourself up properly can make the difference to how you feel when you exercise. To get the most out of your activity, prepare by:
- eating early and right – eat carbohydrate-based foods in plenty of time before exercising for energy and to avoid feeling too full
- getting the essentials together – get your equipment ready, wear light, loose clothing and have a bottle of water and towel to hand
- preparing your space – if you’re at the gym, know what equipment you plan on using and where those things are. If at home, make sure there’s enough room to exercise, move anything in your way and that you won’t be interrupted
- warming up and cooling down – stretching and starting slow helps loosen you up, lowering the chance of getting hurt and improving your movement.
