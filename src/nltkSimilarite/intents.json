This involves placing a stent-graft (a small metal tube covered with a mesh) inside the artery through a small cut in the groin.

They should talk through your options and listen carefully to your views and concerns before you agree to having the procedure. Your family can be involved too, if you wish. It can feel hard to ask questions about difficult topics such as risks and life expectancy, but most people feel better once they do.\n\nTo help decide whether TAVI is right for you, you may have one or more of the following tests:\n\nBlood tests\nEchocardiogram\nECG\nCT scans\nCoronary angiogram\nTrans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE)\nChest X-ray\nBreathing tests\nMany people feel scared to have tests or worry they will hurt but the tests are normally quick and painless.

If you're under 65 years old, it's known as 'young onset' or 'early onset' vascular dementia.\nEarly signs of vascular dementia include:\n- concentration problems, such as struggling to focus during a conversation\n- mood and personality changes, such as irritability or feeling low\n- poor short-term memory\n- difficulty with everyday skills, such as reading or driving\n- difficulty with decision making and planning\n- slowing down of thought processes\n- difficulty saying your thoughts clearly.\n\nIn the later stages, you may experience symptoms such as:\n- becoming increasingly confused and disorientated\n- long-term memory loss and difficulty concentrating\n- increasing difficulty remembering words and communicating\n- difficulty with balance or falling frequently\n- depression and personality changes\n- in some cases, loss of bladder control."]}, {"tag": "vascular dementia-570", "patterns": ["How is vascular dementia diagnosed?"], "responses": ["If you suspect you or a loved one might have vascular dementia, it\u2019s important to talk to your GP as soon as possible. The GP will:\n- explore what your issues are, when they started and how often they have been happening\n- ask how these issues have been affecting your life and those around you\n- carry out physical examinations, mental ability tests and other routine tests to help them rule out other physical or mental health causes.\n\nConsider taking a loved one to you to the appointment, not only for support, but also to help the GP get a complete picture of how things have been for you.\nIf you can\u2019t take a loved one, your GP may want to reach out to them on the phone so they can better understand your daily routine and skills. This will only happen with your permission.\nIf your GP suspects vascular dementia, they will refer you to a specialist or memory clinic. You may then have a CT or MRI scan of your brain to check for any abnormalities.\nUnfortunately, getting an accurate diagnosis can sometimes take time. But it\u2019s important you receive this so you can get the correct treatment and support."]}, {"tag": "vascular dementia-571", "patterns": ["How is vascular dementia treated?"], "responses": ["Although we\u2019re funding research to find new treatments, there's currently no cure for vascular dementia. However, there\u2019s lots of help and support to help you to continue to live well.\n\nWith Medication:\nYou might be given medication to control high blood pressure or high cholesterol. This may have contributed to your condition and controlling it can help slow down the progression.\nIf you have vascular dementia, medication given for Alzheimer\u2019s disease isn\u2019t recommended. However, you could be given this medication if you have a mixed diagnosis of vascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nWith Lifestyle changes:\nResearch has shown that improving your lifestyle can help slow down the progression of vascular dementia. There are some small changes you can make that might reduce the chance of more damage to the blood vessels in your brain:\n- eat healthily\n- be physically active\n- keep to a healthy weight and lose weight if necessary\n- don't smoke\n- cut down on alcohol\n- control high blood pressure\n- control cholesterol levels\n- control blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes).\n\nWith Support programmes:\nYour healthcare team may also suggest a range of social activities to improve your wellbeing and slow down the progression as much as possible. Some examples could be:\n- group cognitive (this means the process of thinking, reasoning, or remembering) stimulation therapy \u2013 taking part in group activities and discussions to help with memory and connecting with others\n- group reminiscence therapy - sharing life experiences, memories and stories from the past to help improve your wellbeing\n- cognitive rehabilitation or occupational therapy \u2013 getting support in carrying out everyday tasks independently for as long as possible."]}, {"tag": "vascular dementia-572", "patterns": ["How to live with vascular dementia?"], "responses": ["Some people diagnosed with vascular dementia are able to live well for many years. However, it's understandable if you feel overwhelmed and worried about how to cope.\nOn a practical level, there are many things you can do to support yourself, or someone diagnosed with vascular dementia. Some examples include:\n- break complex tasks down into small steps\n- use reminders, pill boxes or automatic medication dispensers so you don\u2019t forget to take medications\n- be aware of the things that make your symptoms worse, like noisy places\n- keep to a regular routine and be sure to include activities you enjoy.\n\nVascular dementia is a progressive condition (this means it gets worse over time), so it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll need further support at some point. People involved in your ongoing care might include:\n- healthcare professionals \u2013 your GP, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, or a specialist dementia nurse (such as an Admiral Nurse)\n- social services \u2013 you and your loved ones or carer might be able to access support by having an assessment of your needs\n- charities like Dementia UK can offer information, emotional support or advocacy services\n- private care and support services, such as paid care workers or your council. Other local organisations may provide meals delivered to your home, if you are eligible.\n"]}]}
