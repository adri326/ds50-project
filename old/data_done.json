Your rehabilitation will begin in hospital where specialists, such as nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists will discuss what help you'll need. The aim of rehabilitation is to help return you as close as possible to how you were before the stroke. They also support you to live as independently as you can. If you've had a stroke, you may be at risk of developing vascular dementia. This happens when a stroke damages part of your brain, leading to symptoms such as concentration problems and personality changes. If you have any concerns you should speak to your GP. Stroke is sudden and can be devastating, but many people continue to improve and there is help and support available."

It comes from the food you eat, particularly carbohydrates like bread and potatoes.  Glucose is carried through the bloodstream to cells around the body to give them energy to work. When there's glucose in the bloodstream, the pancreas (an organ near the stomach) makes a hormone (a chemical messenger) called insulin. Insulin tells the body's cells to absorb the glucose and use it as energy.  In somebody with diabetes, their body can't absorb glucose because there is a problem with their insulin. This means:  - their cells don't use the glucose for energy  - the unused glucose stays in their blood and builds up  - the excess glucose can damage their arteries (arteries carry oxygen-rich blood and nutrients around the body) "

This is because type 2 diabetes is linked to having excess weight or obesity. But it can also help you sleep better and feel more energised.  The treatment for type 1 diabetes is insulin injections multiple times a day, regular exercise and a healthy balanced diet.  People with type 1 diabetes can't make insulin because their body attacks the cells that make it. This means their body needs to be given insulin to control their blood sugar levels. And they will need to monitor their blood sugar levels multiple times a day.  There are different types of insulin injections. If you have type 1 diabetes, your doctor will explain the types of insulin you need, how often you need them and how to check your blood sugar levels.  The treatment for type 2 diabetes is usually medication and a keen focus on regular exercise and a healthy balanced diet.  Most people need medicine to control their type 2 diabetes. The medicine helps to lower the amount of sugar in your blood. This can reduce the risk of developing other health problems like heart and circulatory diseases.  Sometimes, people with type 2 diabetes might need insulin injections. And, their doctor might ask them to check their blood sugar levels regularly. But most type 2 diabetics don't have to.  The type of medication, the amount you take and if you need insulin injections might change over time. You will have regular check-ups with your doctor to review your treatment plan. "

Being physically active is another great way to control your blood sugar levels. Exercise helps to lower the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood because your muscles need to use more of it. This can reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases and other complications. Physical activity can also boost your mood; help you feel less tired, and it can be fun too.  Adults in the UK are recommended to get around two and a half hours of exercise a week. As long as you're doing something to get you out of breath, it can be anything:  - swimming  - riding a bike  - brisk walking with your dog  - playing with a frisbee in the park  - pushing a lawn mower or hoovering.  If you are diabetic, it is important to manage your blood pressure and cholesterol level to reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases.

        "definition": " High blood pressure is a serious condition. Your arteries are normally stretchy, so they can cope with your blood pressure going up and down. But with high blood pressure, your arteries lose their stretchiness, becoming stiff or narrow. This narrowing makes it easier for fatty material (atheroma) to build up. This narrowing and damage to the arteries lining your heart or brain could trigger a life-threatening heart attack or stroke. Around 50% of heart attacks and strokes are associated with high blood pressure If left untreated, high blood pressure can also lead to complications such as: - kidney failure - heart failure - problems with your sight"

        "definition": " Angioplasty is a common, generally painless procedure that is used to open up narrowed or blocked arteries (the vessels that supply blood to your heart muscle). You'll be given local anaesthetic at the start of the procedure. A narrow flexible tube (called a catheter) is put into your wrist or groin (the area of your hip between your stomach and thigh) and pushed up to the coronary artery. A small balloon at the end of the tube is blown up to widen the narrowed part of your artery. Sometimes if the artery is so narrow that the balloon can't pass through it, a tiny drill might also be used (this is called rotablation) to chip away at the fatty deposits, to gradually widen the narrowing. Most of the time angioplasty is combined with putting in a small metal mesh tube (called a stent). When the balloon is deflated and the catheter tube and balloon are removed, the stent stays in place, acting like a scaffold to keep your artery open."

You'll also have your blood pressure checked regularly. - Many people experience a feeling of pressure during the angioplasty. If you feel unwell, or have chest pain at any time, tell the team. - After the procedure, the thin tube is removed and there may be a small amount of bleeding when it is taken out. - You'll then come back to the recovery room where you'll be monitored by nurses. - If you had the tube put into your wrist, you'll be sat upright and if everything is okay, could be ready to leave the hospital as little as two hours later. - If you had the tube put into your groin, you'll need to lie on your back at first and stay longer recovering in hospital, around five to six hours. - If you've come in for an emergency angioplasty - for example, following a heart attack - you may be kept overnight."

Things that cause high cholesterol which you can't control: - Your age, biological sex and ethnic background: - getting older - having higher cholesterol is more likely as we age - if your biological sex is male (you were assigned male at birth) - males are more likely to have high cholesterol - your ethnic background - if you are from a south Asian background, you are more likely to have high cholesterol.  Your genes: Genes carry the information that determines your features or characteristics that are passed on to you \u2014 or inherited \u2014 from your parents. Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), is an inherited condition, meaning you were born with it. It is often passed down through families in faulty genes and can lead to very high levels of cholesterol, even if you don't have other risk factors.  Your general health: - kidney disease - when your kidneys aren't working well, it also changes the way your body handles cholesterol, which can lead to high cholesterol - liver disease - an important job of the liver is to both produce cholesterol and clear it from the body, but if the liver isn't working well it struggles to do this, increasing your risk of high cholesterol - if you live with excess weight, especially around your middle - if you have type 2 diabetes, you are at greater risk of having high cholesterol - having an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism - when your body doesn't make enough thyroid hormone)"

Proteins are substances in your body that do most of the work in your cells and help keep your body's tissues and organs working as they should. When cholesterol and proteins combine, they're called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoproteins. One is good for your health; the other is bad. High-density lipoproteins or HDL is known as 'good' cholesterol. It gets rid of the 'bad' cholesterol from your blood by taking cholesterol you don't need back to the liver, where it is broken down and removed from your body. Non-high-density lipoproteins or non-HDL is known as 'bad' cholesterol. Too much non-HDL leads to a build up of fatty deposits inside the walls of the blood vessels (channels that carry blood throughout your body). This builds up and narrows blood vessels, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke. "

        "definition": " The symptoms of vascular dementia can develop suddenly or gradually. Your early symptoms will depend on which part of your brain has been affected. This means different people can experience different symptoms. Vascular dementia can affect people of all ages, although it's often associated with growing older. If you're under 65 years old, it's known as 'young onset' or 'early onset' vascular dementia. Early signs of vascular dementia include: - concentration problems, such as struggling to focus during a conversation - mood and personality changes, such as irritability or feeling low - poor short-term memory - difficulty with everyday skills, such as reading or driving - difficulty with decision making and planning - slowing down of thought processes - difficulty saying your thoughts clearly.  In the later stages, you may experience symptoms such as: - becoming increasingly confused and disorientated - long-term memory loss and difficulty concentrating - increasing difficulty remembering words and communicating - difficulty with balance or falling frequently - depression and personality changes"

        "definition": " If you suspect you or a loved one might have vascular dementia, it's important to talk to your GP as soon as possible. The GP will: - explore what your issues are, when they started and how often they have been happening - ask how these issues have been affecting your life and those around you - carry out physical examinations, mental ability tests and other routine tests to help them rule out other physical or mental health causes.  Consider taking a loved one to you to the appointment, not only for support, but also to help the GP get a complete picture of how things have been for you. If you can't take a loved one, your GP may want to reach out to them on the phone so they can better understand your daily routine and skills. This will only happen with your permission. If your GP suspects vascular dementia, they will refer you to a specialist or memory clinic. You may then have a CT or MRI scan of your brain to check for any abnormalities."

        "definition": " Although we're funding research to find new treatments, there's currently no cure for vascular dementia. However, there's lots of help and support to help you to continue to live well.  With Medication: You might be given medication to control high blood pressure or high cholesterol. This may have contributed to your condition and controlling it can help slow down the progression. If you have vascular dementia, medication given for Alzheimer's disease isn't recommended. However, you could be given this medication if you have a mixed diagnosis of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  With Lifestyle changes: Research has shown that improving your lifestyle can help slow down the progression of vascular dementia. There are some small changes you can make that might reduce the chance of more damage to the blood vessels in your brain: - eat healthily - be physically active - keep to a healthy weight and lose weight if necessary - don't smoke - cut down on alcohol - control high blood pressure - control cholesterol levels - control blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes).  With Support programmes: Your healthcare team may also suggest a range of social activities to improve your wellbeing and slow down the progression as much as possible. Some examples could be: - group cognitive (this means the process of thinking, reasoning, or remembering) stimulation therapy - taking part in group activities and discussions to help with memory and connecting with others - group reminiscence therapy - sharing life experiences, memories and stories from the past to help improve your wellbeing"

The catheter (a thin, flexible tube) will then be passed into an artery. - The catheter will be directed through your blood vessels and up to your heart. The doctors will use X-ray to help guide them to the arteries. - A special dye called contrast will then be passed through the catheter and a series of images will be taken. It is very common to feel a hot, flushing sensation as the dye enters your bloodstream, but this is completely normal and only lasts for a few seconds.

This is common if the procedure is performed through the groin. You will need to stay on bedrest for about an hour. Some doctors prefer to apply a pressure pad to the wound, in which case you will need to stay on bedrest a bit longer, usually around 4 hours.   If your procedure is performed through your wrist, a pressure device to reduce the risk of bleeding is left in place and the nurses will gradually reduce the pressure over a short period of time then remove it altogether. You will be able to sit in a chair almost straight away. The nurses will check your blood pressure and pulse and keep an eye on your wound. It is important to drink plenty of fluid as this helps to flush the dye out of your system. As long as you feel well, you should be able to go home the same day, although this may depend on the results. Your doctor will explain these to you before you leave. The most common after-effect is bruising at the site where the catheter was inserted which may feel tender and numb for a few days. You might feel tired, but you should be back to normal within a few days. If you are worried about any of the after-effects, contact your doctor."

It's used to bypass - or 'get around' - the narrowed or blocked sections of your coronary arteries. Your surgeon takes a blood vessel (a tube that blood moves through) and attaches it between the aorta (the main blood vessel leaving the heart) and a point along the coronary artery. In most cases, at least one of the blood vessels used as a bypass graft is an artery from your chest called the internal mammary artery.

        "definition": " Before the operation, you'll be given medicine (general anaesthetic) that puts you to sleep. The medicine is injected or inhaled as a gas through a mask. A specialist doctor (called an anaesthetist) gives you the medicine before the surgery starts and stays with you to make sure you have enough to keep you asleep. You'll then go into the operating room for the surgery which normally lasts three to six hours. Surgeons usually make a cut down the middle of the breastbone (the long flat bone in the middle of the chest) to reach your heart. If you have a vein graft from your leg or an artery graft from your arm, they will make smaller cuts in these places too. A heart-lung bypass machine will move the blood around your body while the surgeon operates on your heart. Some surgeons may carry out coronary bypass operations without this machine. This is called beating heart surgery. Your surgeon may do newer bypass surgeries like endoscopic or minimally invasive surgery. These involve making several small cuts and using an endoscope camera to see the blood vessels and heart. Surgeons do this because it can help you get up out of bed sooner and speed up recovery. If your surgeon needs to cut your breastbone, you'll have a wound down the middle of your chest. It's normal to be worried or scared about having scars after surgery but you're not alone.

When your doctor decides that you don't need intensive care anymore, you'll be moved to the cardiac ward or the high dependency unit which is for people who need a higher level of care than normal. After that, you can begin your recovery. You should generally be able to sit in a chair after one day, walk after three days and use stairs after five or six days. When you go home, you'll need to relax for a few weeks. You should be able to do most of your normal activities after about six weeks, including working, driving and sex. If you have a heavy manual job, you may need to rest for longer. In many hospitals, after a heart bypass operation, a member of the cardiac specialist team will see you on the ward to give you information about your condition and the treatment you've had. They'll talk to you about making lifestyle changes and how to reduce your risk factors (the things that increase your risk of heart disease) to help protect your heart in the future. They'll offer you cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) to get you fit and strong again too. It's okay to feel low after surgery and the team can help you if you want to talk with them. Many people say their time in hospital becomes a blur. You may find it helpful to write down or have someone with you to help remember the information you get throughout your journey. It's important to look after your heart health long term so you don't develop more heart problems. You can do this by making lifestyle changes such as: - avoiding or drinking less alcohol (no more than the recommended limit of 14 units a week) - eating healthier foods - not smoking or using tobacco products - staying active."

Heart bypass surgery may not be an option if the arteries around your heart are too narrow or blocked. Instead, your doctor may want to do a coronary angioplasty and stent insertion operation. A coronary angioplasty is where a special kind of balloon is gently blown up inside the coronary artery to open it up. A stainless steel mesh called a stent is put in the artery to keep it open and let blood flow normally again. The balloon will be taken out. Before deciding to do an angioplasty, you'll have an angiogram (type of x-ray) that shows how blocked your arteries are. Your doctor will then know what the best treatment is for you. Before and after your surgery, you may need to take medications to support your heart. In some cases, coronary heart disease can be treated with different medications like: - antiplatelets - which help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke - beta blockers - which help reduce the risk of heart conditions like angina and heart attack - statins - which lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of angina, heart attack and stroke."

Some conditions may not be discovered until the child is older or even an adult. In babies and toddlers, congenital heart disease can have a range of symptoms because every child and condition is different. More common symptoms include extreme tiredness, poor feeding, excessive sweating, rapid heartbeat, breathing problems, chest pain and a blue tinge to the skin. If you notice any of these symptoms in your child, you should seek medical attention.  If a congenital heart condition is suspected after your 20-week pregnancy scan: - You may be asked to attend another scan with a specialist or referred to a fetal medicine unit, obstetrician or a specialist in cardiac or child medicine. - If a congenital heart condition is confirmed, you should be given a detailed description of the problem, information about any surgery that might be needed, and the overall long-term outlook. - If appropriate, specialist monitoring and care will be provided before, during and after the birth so that your baby can receive tests and treatment as soon as possible.  Some heart conditions can now also be treated in-utero (in the womb) before the birth.  If a congenital heart condition is suspected in a baby or child: Your child may undergo a physical examination and heart tests such as an ECG."

However, there are some things to keep in mind before getting active: - heart conditions - with some conditions, you may have to think about whether you can use weights, or how intense your exercise can be. If you use GTN spray to manage your chest pain, speak to your doctor or pharmacist about how you can use it alongside exercise - medications - some may affect your exercise. For example, beta blockers affect your heart rate and may make you feel more tired. Talk with your doctor to find the medication that works for you - implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) & pacemakers - most people with these implanted devices can exercise safely and your doctor should tell you if you have any limits to what you should do. This often means sticking to moderate intensity exercise (like walking and gardening) and avoiding contact sports like rugby - listen to your body - you should only exercise if you're feeling well enough to do so. If you start to feel symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations (the feeling like your heart is pounding, or skipping a beat) or unusual shortness of breath, you may need to scale back your exercise.

The recommended types of exercise for improving heart health are: - aerobic exercise - when you're moving your body in a way that makes you warm and slightly out of breath like when walking, cycling, doing housework or gardening. Over time, this type of exercise helps your heart and circulatory system to work better by helping to lower your blood pressure and resting heart rate, improving cholesterol levels and helping you maintain a healthy weight - balance and flexibility exercise - exercise like yoga, tai chi and Pilates where we hold our bodies in less stable positions. These exercises make sure our muscles don't get too tight and keep us flexible, helping avoid pain or injury and reduce the risk of having falls - resistance exercise - resistance training like lifting weights or using resistance bands and cables to strengthen your muscles. The stronger your muscles are, the harder they can work which takes the strain off your heart making it easier to do everyday tasks. Check in with your doctor before you start any resistance training as it may not be suitable for some people with heart conditions.  It's important to remember that getting active doesn't have to mean spending lots of time doing an activity that you may not enjoy. It can be something as simple as playing with your grandkids, walking to the shop or gardening. If it gets you a little out of breath, you're being active."

Intense exercise is when you breathe hard and fast like when running, swimming or cycling. What one person finds moderate may be intense to another. That's why it's helpful to do the 'talk test' while you're exercising to find the right level for you. The talk test: - if you can comfortably talk while being active - feel warm and are breathing a little more heavily than normal - you're moving at the right pace.  Whether it's walking or weights, it's important to start low and slow and to 'listen' to your body. A session could be as little as five or 10 minutes.

This means choosing healthy carbohydrates, lean proteins, eating more fruit and vegetables and keeping hydrated. - carbohydrates - these are your body's main source of energy when you're exercising. It's best to choose high fibre, wholegrain varieties of oats, pasta, rice, breads and cereals. Carbohydrates provide the slow release of energy you need to fuel your exercise. There's no need to eat extra carbohydrates if you're active unless you're training for longer events - fruit and vegetables - these are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fibre which help keep your body and immune system healthy when you exercise. Aim for at least five portions a day - protein - known as the building blocks of life, these help your body grow and repair. You should try and include a portion of protein like lean meat, fish, eggs, dairy or alternatives sources like peas, pulses or beans with most meals - fluids - exercising raises your body temperature and your body tries to cool down by sweating. This causes a loss of water and salts through the skin. How much fluid you need depends on how long you exercise for, the temperature, and the amount you sweat. For most people, unless you are exercising for more than an hour, drinking 6-8 glasses of fluid (water, squash, fruit juice, caffeine-free teas) a day is a good idea.  Allow enough time to eat and drink before exercising to ensure your food is fully digested and avoid feeling sick or uncomfortable during exercise. Try to have a balanced meal 2-3 hours before exercising."

Challenging yourself and getting better at an activity is fun - make exercise part of your day - plan a time to do some physical activity that fits in with the rest of your day like by walking or cycling instead of driving. It could even be something as small as parking your car further from the shop or getting off the bus a stop early. If you miss a day, don't worry - just make sure you start again when you can - keep moving - everyday activities count, so look out for opportunities to be active during the day while you're inside or outdoors. Whilst moving, don't change position too quickly as this can cause dizziness - start small - try breaking down your exercise into short sessions throughout the day and build up from there. You could start by taking a five minute walk every day or trying our 10-minute workout - set realistic goals - setting goals like doing a short walk outside every day is fun and makes you feel great when you achieve them. If you want to keep setting new goals, read about using the FITT principle - set reminders where you can see them - stick post-it notes on the fridge or set daily reminders on your phone so you don't forget (it's easily done) - get variety - make a list of enjoyable activities you can do such as dancing or cycling and do a different activity each week. This way you're less likely to get bored and lose interest - be proud of yourself - pat yourself on the back when you hit a goal. You've looked after your heart and that's something to be proud of."
