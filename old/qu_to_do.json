Your doctor will also ask whether you have a history of high cholesterol or heart conditions in your family.\nIf your results come back high, or if your doctor notices some of the physical signs of FH listed above, they will refer you to a specialist for an assessment, which is likely to include genetic testing. The specialist will explain which of your relatives should be checked out, too.\nGenetic testing is a DNA test that\u2019s done to see if you have a faulty gene which can cause an inherited condition. This test may be:\n- a blood sample\n- a mouth swab, from the inside of your cheek.\nIf you\u2019re diagnosed with FH, your first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) should also be tested as soon as possible. FH is an inherited condition which means that if a parent has FH, their child has a 50% chance of inheriting it.\nIf one of your family members has FH, you should get tested as well. Early diagnosis of FH means you can get treatment and improve your lifestyle to lower your cholesterol and avoid risk to your health."

Treatment can greatly reduce your risk of getting coronary heart disease, having a heart attack or stroke, or needing other treatments. If you or your child is diagnosed with FH, your doctor will discuss and agree a treatment plan with you.\nFH is usually treated using medicines called statins, which help to lower your cholesterol levels.\nThere are other types of medicines which can be used to lower blood cholesterol levels either instead of or as well as statins. These are:\n- ezetimibe\n- PCSK9 inhibitors such as alirocumab and evolocumab\n- bempedoic acid\n- inclisiran\n- fibrates such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate.\nAs well as taking medications, you'll need to make changes to your diet and lifestyle which also help to improve your cholesterol level.\nPeople with high cholesterol often find they can bring their levels of cholesterol down just by changing their diet. Unfortunately, FH can\u2019t be treated through diet alone, but you should still make sure you:\n- maintain a healthy weight\n- do plenty of exercise\n- don\u2019t smoke\n- drink less alcohol."

Post menopause, your risk rises and continues to rise as you get older. \nAs you get older it is increasingly important to be aware of the risk factors that can affect your risk of developing CHD. The more risk factors you have, the higher your risk. Risk factors include:\n- high blood pressure\n- high cholesterol\n- diabetes\n- smoking\n- being overweight\n- not doing enough physical activity.\nIdentifying and managing risk factors early on could help lower your risk of a heart attack in the future.  \nWe recommend that all women over the age of 40 visit their local GP or nurse for a health check to check their cardiovascular risk. If you're aged 40\u201374 and living in England, you can ask for an NHS health check. Similar schemes are also available in other parts of the UK.\nYour doctor should invite you to review your risk every five years, but you can also just make an appointment yourself to check your blood pressure and cholesterol. This check might help to highlight anything that could put you at increased risk of having a heart attack.\nIf you have a family history of heart or circulatory disease make sure you tell your doctor or nurse. You're considered to have a family history of heart or circulatory disease if:\n- your father or brother was under the age of 55 when they were diagnosed with a heart or circulatory disease or\n- your mother or sister was under the age of 65 when they were diagnosed with a heart or circulatory disease."

Ions are charged atoms which allow electrical signals to flow in and out of cells through special channels and help your body function normally. There are different kinds of ions, including potassium and sodium, which are important for keeping the electrical system of your heart working properly.\nThe electrical system controls your heart by telling it when to squeeze and relax to pump blood. Between each heartbeat, the electrical system recharges. If you have LQTS, your heart takes longer than usual to recharge between beats.\nThis is because the channels are not letting the ions in or out of your cells well enough, which causes a delay. When seen on an ECG test (which records the electrical activity of your heart), this delay is called a prolonged QT interval."

This is because the immune system, the body\u2019s own natural defence system, overreacts to being infected with a virus, and causes inflammation. This inflammation can stay in the heart even after the virus has gone.\n\nOther causes include:\n\n- bacterial infections, such as sore throat, or chest infection, or fungal infections, such as athlete\u2019s foot\n- auto immune diseases (when your own immune system attacks your body), for example lupus\n- a reaction to harmful substances (toxins), such as carbon monoxide, or drugs such as cocaine\n- a reaction to certain medicines or vaccines\n- There have been rare cases of myocarditis following the Moderna covid vaccine (or even more rarely, the Pfizer vaccine). If you are worried, you can find out more about what covid vaccines mean for your heart.\n\nSometimes it isn\u2019t possible to find the cause of myocarditis. This can be frustrating and difficult for you. There is support available to help you manage your condition and your wellbeing\n\nMyocarditis can affect anyone, of any age, but it tends to affect more males than females, and people under 50."

Your heart\u2019s rhythm and electrical impulses are no longer there after death, this means an abnormal heart rhythm can\u2019t be found and the heart\u2019s structure will appear normal. This is why the cause of the cardiac arrest can\u2019t be found and SADS might be diagnosed.\n\n**Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome affects around 500 people in the UK every year.**\n\nYou may also see sudden arrhythmic death syndrome, or SADS, being called sudden adult death syndrome.\n\nFind out more about Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome, what to expect from an inherited heart condition clinic and how you and your family can get support if you know someone who has sadly died suddenly.\n\nDownload Life with Inherited Abnormal Heart Rhythms"

            "What causes SADS?"
        ],
        "definition": "SADS usually happens when an abnormal heart rhythm, known as an arrhythmia, goes untreated and leads to a cardiac arrest. An arrhythmia usually causes the heart to beat too fast, too slow or irregularly. It is usually caused by a heart condition that affects the heart\u2019s electrical system.\n\nSometimes, the heart condition that causes the arrhythmia can be inherited. Inherited heart conditions are often the cause of SADS if they are left undetected and untreated. These conditions include:\n\n- Long QT syndrome (LQTS)\n- Brugada syndrome\n- Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)\n- Progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD).\n\nA condition that causes SADS is undetectable after death because the heart will appear normal. But there are a few conditions that can cause SADS because of very subtle changes to the heart. SADS may still be diagnosed because the structural changes are too small to be seen when the heart is examined after death.\n\nThese conditions include:\n\n- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)\n- Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)\n- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)\n\nThanks to research, we now know that these conditions are caused by changes (or mutations) in one or more of our genes. We can sometimes discover these changes with genetic testing for family members, known as cascade testing. In some cases, this is the only way of telling if someone has an inherited heart condition or if they are at risk of developing one."

            "How is SADS diagnosed?"
        ],
        "definition": "After an unexpected and sudden death, a coroner (someone who is responsible for investigating deaths) will usually ask for a post-mortem examination to be carried out to find out the cause of death. A post-mortem usually happens within two to three working days after the death.\n\nIf you have recently lost a loved one suddenly, or know someone who has, you may want to contact a bereavement officer at your local hospital. They can offer emotional and practical support during what might be an extremely difficult time for you, and they can be your main point of contact after the death and the post-mortem examination.\n\nDuring the post-mortem examination, a pathologist (a doctor trained in the study of disease) will look for conditions that could have caused the death, such as:\n\n- coronary heart disease\n- heart attack\n- heart failure\n- clots on the lungs\n\nIf the pathologist can\u2019t find an obvious cause of death, they may do further tests such as:\n\n- look at organ tissue\n- test for medications or drugs in the body\n- ask for an assessment by an expert heart pathologist.\n\nThe coroner will then decide on a cause of death. SADS is declared if the death is still unexplained after these tests.\n\nWhen this happens, the coroner will usually recommend that family members are tested for inherited heart conditions. Some people might not feel ready to be tested after losing a loved one which is understandable, but the tests are usually simple for most people. The earlier you and your family are tested, the less you risk a family member possibly leaving a heart problem untreated.\n\nIf someone in your family has been diagnosed with a heart condition or has passed away from SADS, you might be referred to a Genetics Clinic to assess your risk of developing the condition too."

It can also be carried out on a sample of hair, skin or bodily tissue.\n\nGenetic tests can find genetic faults. A fault could mean you are at risk of developing the same inherited heart condition that your family member has.\n\nIf someone has a heart condition or has died from SADS, the immediate family (their parents, siblings and children) might be referred for genetic tests. The tests are normally done in an inherited heart condition clinic at a hospital or genetics centre.\n\nDuring your appointment, you might also be asked about your health, family history and if you have any symptoms. It\u2019s helpful to bring information about any family members who have passed away unexpectedly or have been diagnosed with heart and circulatory diseases."

        "definition": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an emergency condition when a tear appears in the wall of a coronary artery, which supplies blood to your heart. In some cases this can lead to a heart attack or cardiac arrest.\n\nYour coronary arteries are made up of three layers. SCAD happens when one or more of the inner layers of a coronary artery tears away from the outer layer.\n\nBlood is able to flow into the space between the layers and a blood clot forms, reducing the flow of blood through the artery.\n\nThis can lead to a heart attack, as the blood supply to your heart has been blocked. Or a cardiac arrest.\n\nSCAD is a rare heart condition that happens suddenly with no apparent warning. It is most common in women who are in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, but can happen to anyone. The condition can\u2019t currently be predicted or prevented.\n\nMost people who have SCAD do not have usual risk factors for heart disease such as high cholesterol, smoking or diabetes. These are often the risk factors which can increase your chance of having a heart attack. This means that SCAD is can be misdiagnosed or there may be a delay in diagnosis.\n\nPeople with no risk factors often ignore symptoms, as they don\u2019t think they\u2019d be at risk of a heart attack. But it\u2019s important to get checked out if you get any SCAD symptoms, so it can be diagnosed as early as possible."

Risk factors include:\n\n- high blood pressure\n- high cholesterol\n- diabetes\n- smoking\n- being overweight\n- not doing enough physical activity.\n\nIdentifying and managing risk factors early on could help lower your risk of a heart attack in the future.\n\nWe recommend that all women over the age of 40 visit their local GP or nurse for a health check to check their cardiovascular risk. If you're aged 40\u201374 and living in England, you can ask for an NHS health check. Similar schemes are also available in other parts of the UK.\n\nYour doctor should invite you to review your risk every five years, but you can also just make an appointment yourself to check your blood pressure and cholesterol. This check might help to highlight anything that could put you at increased risk of having a heart attack.\n\nIf you have a family history of heart or circulatory disease make sure you tell your doctor or nurse. You're considered to have a family history of heart or circulatory disease if:\n\n- your father or brother was under the age of 55 when they were diagnosed with a heart or circulatory disease or\n- your mother or sister was under the age of 65 when they were diagnosed with a heart or circulatory disease."

        ],
        "definition": "A normal adult heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm while resting. Your heart rate can change every minute and what\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 is different for everyone because of their age and health. Your lifestyle - such as whether you smoke, exercise and how much alcohol you drink - also affects your heart rate.\n\nYou can find your normal resting heart rate by counting the number of times your heart beats in a minute. Sitting still for 5 - 10 minutes before counting makes sure your heart is in its resting state. Knowing your normal heart rate when living with your heart condition can help you feel more confident and improve your quality of life."

        "definition": "An arrhythmia (or heart rhythm issue) is when the heart beats too slowly, too quickly, or irregularly. An arrhythmia can be dangerous because blood isn\u2019t pumped well enough around the body causing symptoms like dizziness, fainting and shortness of breath. An abnormal heart rate could also increase the risk of stroke.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that more than 2 million people in the UK experience heart rhythm issues.

Regular exercise improves overall health by helping manage many of the risk factors for heart and circulatory diseases, such as diabetes. Regular exercise also boosts energy and mood, as well as quality of sleep.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for your heart rate to increase while exercising. During exercise, you should aim to stay within your target heart rate (THR) to increase your fitness safely. Your THR is between 50% and 70% of your maximum heart rate.\n\nIf you have a heart condition, ask your GP or specialist about a safe heart rate when you're exercising. It may be helpful to do the \u2018talk test\u2019 while you are exercising. The talk test: if you can talk while being active, feel warm and are breathing a little more heavily than normal, you're moving at the right pace."

The most common places to take blood are from a vein inside your elbow or a vein on the back of your hand as your veins are closer to the surface there.\n\nA tight band (tourniquet) is placed around your arm just above the area where the blood is to be taken. This causes the vein to come nearer to the surface of your skin, making it easier for your blood sample to be taken. The area will be cleaned with an antiseptic wipe or swab before the test is taken.\n\nThe needle is usually attached to either a syringe or a plastic device called a vacutainer and the blood put into a blood collecting container called a vial, so once the blood sample has been taken it can easily be sent to a laboratory for analysis. The vials often contain small amounts of chemical stopping the blood from clotting in transit.\n\nTaking a sample of blood usually only takes a few minutes."

If you feel anxious about your blood test, ask a family member or friend to go along with you. It may be possible for you to apply a cream that numbs the area before you have the test, but this will take a little while to be effective, so it might be an idea to apply it before you go to have the test done.\n\nRarely, some people feel faint during a blood test. This is more likely to happen if you are dehydrated, so try to drink some water before having your blood test. Let the doctor or healthcare professional know if you are prone to fainting before the test as they may suggest you lie down while having your blood taken."

If the levels are abnormal they can be linked to some heart conditions and symptoms linked to having a slow or fast heart rate or palpitations.\n- **Lipid profile** - measures your cholesterol level and breakdown of good and bad fats found in your blood.\n- **Liver tests** - the liver is a vital organ with many functions. This test gives a breakdown of how well the liver is functioning, which if not working well can have a major impact on the rest of the body.\n- **Clotting screen** - this measures how quickly your blood clots. This is important if you take blood thinning medication such as warfarin.\n- **BNP (B-type natriuretic peptides) tests** \u2013 these show the level of a hormone in your blood which if elevated can be a sign of heart failure.\n- **U and Es test** \u2013 this stands for urea (a protein found in the blood) and electrolytes which measures the levels of sodium, potassium and other important chemicals in your blood such as magnesium and calcium.

        "definition": "An electrophysiological (EP) study is a test which looks at your heart's electrical activity in more detail.\n\nIt\u2019s used to diagnose and treat a wide variety of abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nAn EP study is carried out in a cath lab by a specialist cardiac doctor called an electrophysiologist. It usually takes about 2-3 hours, but can take longer. You\u2019ll be asked not to eat or drink anything for a few hours beforehand.\n\n- Thin flexible tubes called catheters are inserted into a vein, usually in the groin. You\u2019ll have a local anaesthetic injection to numb the area where the catheters are put in. You may also be given a sedative to help you relax during the procedure.\n- The catheters are passed up to the heart. This can induce an arrhythmia (an abnormal heart rhythm).\n- You may feel lightheaded or like you\u2019re having palpitations. You may also feel a sensation or discomfort in your chest. You should tell the staff if you experience any symptoms."

They pick up the electrical signals from your heart and recognise if your heart rate or rhythm are abnormal. The information is then recorded and stored in its memory for your medical team to review.\n\nWhen your device recognises something unusual, it will either begin recording your heart\u2019s activity automatically, or you might need to:\n\n- Manually start the recording using a small, hand-held activator machine when you feel symptoms\n- Use a mobile phone app to manually record the activity.\n\nIf your device needs you to use an activator, hold it over the area of your chest where you ILR is, and it will begin recording. Your healthcare team will tell you if you can use the mobile phone app for your device and how to use it, or show you how to use your activator before you go home. They will also answer any questions you have.\n\nThe recording will either be sent to your medical team automatically using a small bedside monitoring machine you might be given, or you might be asked to go to the hospital clinic where the results can be downloaded. Both options are quick and won\u2019t need a procedure, and you will be told which one you need to do."

If you are unable to exercise you may be given a medicine instead which increases your heart rate. The camera takes pictures of your heart while you are exercising and your heart rate and blood pressure will be closely monitored throughout.\n\nYou will then have a break of about an hour, in which you will be asked to drink plenty to clear the radiation from your system.

Here are some things you can do to help your recovery:\n\nattend all your appointments \u2013 it\u2019s important to go even if you feel well so doctors can check how you\u2019re doing and change medications if needed\nkeep your surgery wound clean and dry\ntake your medication exactly as prescribed. Contact your transplant team if you have problems with your medications or if you are not sure how or when to take them\nwear sunblock when you go outside and spend less time in the sun during hot parts of the year. After a transplant you\u2019re at a higher risk of developing skin cancer\ndon\u2019t smoke \u2013 this is a fresh start to keep your heart healthy\ndo regular exercise - such as walking around your home and building up to short walks outside\neat a healthy, balanced diet \u2013 start by getting 1-2 portions of fruit and veg with every meal and avoid too much sugar, saturated fats and salt\naim to control your cholesterol and blood pressure levels - swap saturated fats (butter, processed meats, biscuits) for unsaturated fats (olive oil, oily fish, nuts), maintaining a healthy weight, and reduce salt in your diet.\nAnother important way to recover is to be aware of personal and food hygiene to avoid getting an infection. You can do this by:\n\navoiding anyone who has an infection, including cold, flu and Covid\nnot eating high-risk foods that could cause food poisoning such as raw eggs, mayonnaise, raw meats, unpasteurised milk and cheeses, and shellfish\nkeeping your pets healthy, wormed, and vaccinated so you don\u2019t pick up any parasites or germs that can cause illness. You should also avoid changing cat litter trays (the infection toxoplasmosis is carried by cats)\nwashing your hands after gardening or if you have been handling any pets to avoid picking up parasites and germs.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to get onto a cardiac rehab programme. Cardiac rehab can help you to recover as quickly as possible and talk about your experience with others who've been through similar.

Thin wires connect the ICD to the heart, where it's always checking your heart rate and rhythm. It monitors your heart rhythm through the electrodes.\n\nIf an ICD notices a dangerous heart rhythm it can deliver one or more of the following treatments:\n\nPacing \u2013 a series of low-voltage electrical impulses (paced beats) at a fast rate to try and correct the heart rhythm.\nCardioversion \u2013 one or more small electric shocks to try and restore the heart to a normal rhythm.\nDefibrillation \u2013 one or more larger electric shocks to try and restore the heart to a normal rhythm."

The time it takes will depend on the type of device you are given. You'll often (but not always) need to stay overnight in hospital and your ICD will be checked thoroughly before you leave.\nThe ICD is inserted just under your collar bone. It looks similar to a pacemaker and is a little bigger than a matchbox. \n\nAn ICD is made up of:\na pulse generator \u2013 a battery powered electronic circuit\none or more electrode leads, which are placed into your heart through a vein.\nA different type of ICD is suitable for some people. It's called a subcutaneous (under the skin) ICD \u2013 or SICD for short. An SICD works in the same way as an ICD, but it's inserted under the skin of the chest (outside of the ribcage) and there are no leads placed into the heart. Your doctor will talk to you about this option if it\u2019s right for you."

This is usually because you have inherited faulty genes and may have a condition such as Cardiomyopathy, Long QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome\nyou have heart failure and are at risk of developing a life-threatening heart rhythm. This is called cardiac resynchronisation therapy with a defibrillator, or CRT-D. This single device combines a pacemaker with an ICD.

It improves the blood flow in your heart by replacing an aortic valve that doesn\u2019t open fully.\n\nTAVI can also be called Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). There is no difference between TAVI and TAVR \u2013 they are just different names for the same procedure. TAVI is more commonly used in the UK, TAVR in the USA.\n\nTAVI is a common, mostly painless procedure. A narrow flexible tube (called a catheter) is put into a blood vessel in your upper leg or chest and is passed towards your aortic valve in your heart. The tube is used to fix a replacement valve over the top of your old one."

            "Why would you need a TAVI?"
        ],
        "definition": "If you have a condition called aortic stenosis, your aortic valve doesn\u2019t open fully.\n\nYour heart valves play an important role in keeping blood flowing through your heart. The aortic valve opens to let blood flow from your heart to your aorta. The aorta is the big vessel supplying your body with oxygen-rich blood.\n\nIf you have severe aortic stenosis, you may need to replace your aortic valve.\n\nTAVI was originally used as an alternative to heart valve surgery for people who weren\u2019t well enough to have open heart surgery to replace their aortic valves. But TAVI is now being used for people at lower risk of complications from heart surgery because research is showing it\u2019s at least as effective as heart valve surgery after one year. TAVI is also showing signs of working over a longer period, but more research is needed before it becomes the first choice for patients with severe aortic stenosis.\n\nWe encourage you to discuss with your doctor whether TAVI or heart valve surgery is right for you. They should talk through your options and listen carefully to your views and concerns before you agree to having the procedure. Your family can be involved too, if you wish. It can feel hard to ask questions about difficult topics such as risks and life expectancy, but most people feel better once they do.\n\nTo help decide whether TAVI is right for you, you may have one or more of the following tests:\n\nBlood tests\nEchocardiogram\nECG\nCT scans\nCoronary angiogram\nTrans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE)\nChest X-ray\nBreathing tests\nMany people feel scared to have tests or worry they will hurt but the tests are normally quick and painless. Your doctor or nurse will talk you through what each test involves and can answer any questions."

A smaller number of people may have complications after a TAVI procedure.
