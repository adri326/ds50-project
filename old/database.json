This means less blood gets to the surrounding brain cells causing them to die. - Mini-strokes, or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), happen when there's an interruption in blood flow to part of the brain for a short time causing symptoms, such as temporary speech loss. TIA's usually resolve after a few seconds or minutes."

However, it can take months or sometimes years. Your rehabilitation will begin in hospital where specialists, such as nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists will discuss what help you'll need. The aim of rehabilitation is to help return you as close as possible to how you were before the stroke. They also support you to live as independently as you can. If you've had a stroke, you may be at risk of developing vascular dementia. This happens when a stroke damages part of your brain, leading to symptoms such as concentration problems and personality changes. If you have any concerns you should speak to your GP. Stroke is sudden and can be devastating, but many people continue to improve and there is help and support available."

Aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week. This is anything that raises your heart rate, and makes you breathe faster and feel warmer, like brisk walking or cycling. You can spread out the 150 minutes over the week. You can even do short bursts of activity - every minute counts. You should also aim to do muscle strengthening activities like using hand weights, climbing the stairs, gardening such as digging, or carrying heavy shopping on at least two days a week. "

It comes from the food you eat, particularly carbohydrates like bread and potatoes.  Glucose is carried through the bloodstream to cells around the body to give them energy to work. When there's glucose in the bloodstream, the pancreas (an organ near the stomach) makes a hormone (a chemical messenger) called insulin. Insulin tells the body's cells to absorb the glucose and use it as energy.  In somebody with diabetes, their body can't absorb glucose because there is a problem with their insulin. This means:  - their cells don't use the glucose for energy  - the unused glucose stays in their blood and builds up  - the excess glucose can damage their arteries (arteries carry oxygen-rich blood and nutrients around the body) "

Eating a healthy balanced diet and being physically active are recommended to support the treatment for both types, especially type 2. This is because type 2 diabetes is linked to having excess weight or obesity. But it can also help you sleep better and feel more energised.  The treatment for type 1 diabetes is insulin injections multiple times a day, regular exercise and a healthy balanced diet.  People with type 1 diabetes can't make insulin because their body attacks the cells that make it. This means their body needs to be given insulin to control their blood sugar levels. And they will need to monitor their blood sugar levels multiple times a day.  There are different types of insulin injections. If you have type 1 diabetes, your doctor will explain the types of insulin you need, how often you need them and how to check your blood sugar levels.  The treatment for type 2 diabetes is usually medication and a keen focus on regular exercise and a healthy balanced diet.  Most people need medicine to control their type 2 diabetes. The medicine helps to lower the amount of sugar in your blood. This can reduce the risk of developing other health problems like heart and circulatory diseases.  Sometimes, people with type 2 diabetes might need insulin injections. And, their doctor might ask them to check their blood sugar levels regularly. But most type 2 diabetics don't have to.  The type of medication, the amount you take and if you need insulin injections might change over time. You will have regular check-ups with your doctor to review your treatment plan. "

Being physically active is another great way to control your blood sugar levels. Exercise helps to lower the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood because your muscles need to use more of it. This can reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases and other complications. Physical activity can also boost your mood; help you feel less tired, and it can be fun too.  Adults in the UK are recommended to get around two and a half hours of exercise a week. As long as you're doing something to get you out of breath, it can be anything:  - swimming  - riding a bike  - brisk walking with your dog  - playing with a frisbee in the park  - pushing a lawn mower or hoovering.  If you are diabetic, it is important to manage your blood pressure and cholesterol level to reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases. And having a healthy weight is the best way to manage your blood pressure, cholesterol level and diabetes. "

You'll be given local anaesthetic at the start of the procedure. A narrow flexible tube (called a catheter) is put into your wrist or groin (the area of your hip between your stomach and thigh) and pushed up to the coronary artery. A small balloon at the end of the tube is blown up to widen the narrowed part of your artery. Sometimes if the artery is so narrow that the balloon can't pass through it, a tiny drill might also be used (this is called rotablation) to chip away at the fatty deposits, to gradually widen the narrowing. Most of the time angioplasty is combined with putting in a small metal mesh tube (called a stent). When the balloon is deflated and the catheter tube and balloon are removed, the stent stays in place, acting like a scaffold to keep your artery open."

With angioplasty and stenting, common complications can include: - bleeding, bruising, or an infection where the catheter tube is put into the body (in the wrist or groin) - blood clots - these can form within stents even after the procedure, so it's important to take any prescribed medicine such as aspirin and anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel  The risk of major complications during an angioplasty is usually less than one percent. Rare risks of angioplasty and stenting include: - complications after or during the procedure, such as a heart attack or stroke - an allergic reaction to the contrast dye used during the procedure - very rarely damage to the coronary artery during the procedure"

        "definition": " An angioplasty normally takes between 30 minutes and two hours, although it can take longer in some cases. You'll usually be awake during the procedure. - You'll be asked not to eat or drink for four to six hours before the angioplasty - You'll change into your gown and will be asked to remove any jewellery that might get in the way. - You will usually be awake and lying on your back for the angioplasty. You may be given a sedative to help you relax - talk to your doctor about this if you are nervous. - You'll be given a local anaesthetic injection in your wrist or groin. A thin tube (the catheter) is then passed into your artery through the numbed area. - A special dye (called a contrast dye) is injected into the tube so that your coronary arteries can be seen on an x-ray screen. This part is called an angiogram. It's normal to feel a flushing sensation when the dye enters your bloodstream - for some people, this might feel as though they are weeing themselves. - During your procedure, you'll be attached to a heart monitor that records your heart rate and rhythm and you'll have a clip measuring your oxygen levels on your finger. You'll also have your blood pressure checked regularly. - Many people experience a feeling of pressure during the angioplasty. If you feel unwell, or have chest pain at any time, tell the team. - After the procedure, the thin tube is removed and there may be a small amount of bleeding when it is taken out. - You'll then come back to the recovery room where you'll be monitored by nurses. - If you had the tube put into your wrist, you'll be sat upright and if everything is okay, could be ready to leave the hospital as little as two hours later. - If you had the tube put into your groin, you'll need to lie on your back at first and stay longer recovering in hospital, around five to six hours. - If you've come in for an emergency angioplasty - for example, following a heart attack - you may be kept overnight."

When you get home, check the area where the catheter tube was put in. Expect to have some bruising and tenderness, but you should contact your doctor if: - you get any pain, redness or swelling - or if the bruising worsens - or if you develop a temperature  Before you leave hospital, someone will have a chat with you about your recovery and what you can and can't do. It's normal to feel tired afterwards but most people find that they're back to normal after a few days. However, if you've also had a heart attack, it will take longer to recover. If you've had a stent fitted, you'll be given medicines to help reduce the risk of blood clots forming in and around the stent. They may include: - aspirin - anti-platelet medication such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel You may also be asked to take cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins. If you've had an emergency angioplasty, you may be invited to go on a cardiac rehab programme, a course of exercise and information sessions that help you to recover as quickly as possible."

But sometimes other heart arteries can be narrowed too, so you may still have some angina symptoms. If you get chest pain, stop and rest, and take your GTN if you've been prescribed it.

Things that cause high cholesterol which you can't control: - Your age, biological sex and ethnic background: - getting older - having higher cholesterol is more likely as we age - if your biological sex is male (you were assigned male at birth) - males are more likely to have high cholesterol - your ethnic background - if you are from a south Asian background, you are more likely to have high cholesterol.  Your genes: Genes carry the information that determines your features or characteristics that are passed on to you \u2014 or inherited \u2014 from your parents. Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), is an inherited condition, meaning you were born with it. It is often passed down through families in faulty genes and can lead to very high levels of cholesterol, even if you don't have other risk factors.  Your general health: - kidney disease - when your kidneys aren't working well, it also changes the way your body handles cholesterol, which can lead to high cholesterol - liver disease - an important job of the liver is to both produce cholesterol and clear it from the body, but if the liver isn't working well it struggles to do this, increasing your risk of high cholesterol - if you live with excess weight, especially around your middle - if you have type 2 diabetes, you are at greater risk of having high cholesterol - having an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism - when your body doesn't make enough thyroid hormone)"

When cholesterol and proteins combine, they're called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoproteins. One is good for your health; the other is bad. High-density lipoproteins or HDL is known as 'good' cholesterol. It gets rid of the 'bad' cholesterol from your blood by taking cholesterol you don't need back to the liver, where it is broken down and removed from your body. Non-high-density lipoproteins or non-HDL is known as 'bad' cholesterol. Too much non-HDL leads to a build up of fatty deposits inside the walls of the blood vessels (channels that carry blood throughout your body). This builds up and narrows blood vessels, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke. "

It's often a hidden risk factor which means it can happen without us knowing until it's too late. That is why it's so important to get your cholesterol level checked. However, if you have familial hypercholesterolaemia, you may have visible signs of high cholesterol. These include: - Tendon xanthomata - swellings made from cholesterol on the knuckles of your hands, your knees or the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. - Xanthelasmas - small, yellow lumps of cholesterol near the inner corner of your eye."

Consider taking a loved one to you to the appointment, not only for support, but also to help the GP get a complete picture of how things have been for you. If you can't take a loved one, your GP may want to reach out to them on the phone so they can better understand your daily routine and skills. This will only happen with your permission.

However, there's lots of help and support to help you to continue to live well.  With Medication: You might be given medication to control high blood pressure or high cholesterol. This may have contributed to your condition and controlling it can help slow down the progression. If you have vascular dementia, medication given for Alzheimer's disease isn't recommended. However, you could be given this medication if you have a mixed diagnosis of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  With Lifestyle changes: Research has shown that improving your lifestyle can help slow down the progression of vascular dementia. There are some small changes you can make that might reduce the chance of more damage to the blood vessels in your brain: - eat healthily - be physically active - keep to a healthy weight and lose weight if necessary - don't smoke - cut down on alcohol - control high blood pressure - control cholesterol levels - control blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes).  With Support programmes: Your healthcare team may also suggest a range of social activities to improve your wellbeing and slow down the progression as much as possible. Some examples could be: - group cognitive (this means the process of thinking, reasoning, or remembering) stimulation therapy - taking part in group activities and discussions to help with memory and connecting with others - group reminiscence therapy - sharing life experiences, memories and stories from the past to help improve your wellbeing"

This is common if the procedure is performed through the groin. You will need to stay on bedrest for about an hour. Some doctors prefer to apply a pressure pad to the wound, in which case you will need to stay on bedrest a bit longer, usually around 4 hours.   If your procedure is performed through your wrist, a pressure device to reduce the risk of bleeding is left in place and the nurses will gradually reduce the pressure over a short period of time then remove it altogether. You will be able to sit in a chair almost straight away. The nurses will check your blood pressure and pulse and keep an eye on your wound. It is important to drink plenty of fluid as this helps to flush the dye out of your system. As long as you feel well, you should be able to go home the same day, although this may depend on the results. Your doctor will explain these to you before you leave. The most common after-effect is bruising at the site where the catheter was inserted which may feel tender and numb for a few days. You might feel tired, but you should be back to normal within a few days. If you are worried about any of the after-effects, contact your doctor."

        "definition": " Atherosclerosis is a common condition that can affect anyone, particularly if you're over 65 or have a family history of heart or circulatory diseases. It's caused by a build-up of fatty material called atheroma (or plaque) in your artery walls (where blood passes from the heart to the rest of the body). Atheroma builds up as the walls of your arteries harden and narrow until blood can't pass properly from your heart to the rest of your body. Many people don't know they have atherosclerosis since atheroma takes time to build up and often doesn't cause symptoms until it's serious."

It's used to bypass - or 'get around' - the narrowed or blocked sections of your coronary arteries. Your surgeon takes a blood vessel (a tube that blood moves through) and attaches it between the aorta (the main blood vessel leaving the heart) and a point along the coronary artery. In most cases, at least one of the blood vessels used as a bypass graft is an artery from your chest called the internal mammary artery. Blood vessels such as a vein from your legs and sometimes an artery from your arms are used for the other grafts."

        "definition": " Before the operation, you'll be given medicine (general anaesthetic) that puts you to sleep. The medicine is injected or inhaled as a gas through a mask. A specialist doctor (called an anaesthetist) gives you the medicine before the surgery starts and stays with you to make sure you have enough to keep you asleep. You'll then go into the operating room for the surgery which normally lasts three to six hours. Surgeons usually make a cut down the middle of the breastbone (the long flat bone in the middle of the chest) to reach your heart. If you have a vein graft from your leg or an artery graft from your arm, they will make smaller cuts in these places too. A heart-lung bypass machine will move the blood around your body while the surgeon operates on your heart. Some surgeons may carry out coronary bypass operations without this machine. This is called beating heart surgery. Your surgeon may do newer bypass surgeries like endoscopic or minimally invasive surgery. These involve making several small cuts and using an endoscope camera to see the blood vessels and heart. Surgeons do this because it can help you get up out of bed sooner and speed up recovery. If your surgeon needs to cut your breastbone, you'll have a wound down the middle of your chest. It's normal to be worried or scared about having scars after surgery but you're not alone. Listen to people who have had heart surgery and how they learned to accept their scars."

        ],
        "definition": " After your operation, you'll be moved to intensive care or a specialist recovery department. This is where people who need special monitoring after surgery go so a close eye can be kept on them. When your doctor decides that you don't need intensive care anymore, you'll be moved to the cardiac ward or the high dependency unit which is for people who need a higher level of care than normal. After that, you can begin your recovery. You should generally be able to sit in a chair after one day, walk after three days and use stairs after five or six days. When you go home, you'll need to relax for a few weeks. You should be able to do most of your normal activities after about six weeks, including working, driving and sex. If you have a heavy manual job, you may need to rest for longer. In many hospitals, after a heart bypass operation, a member of the cardiac specialist team will see you on the ward to give you information about your condition and the treatment you've had. They'll talk to you about making lifestyle changes and how to reduce your risk factors (the things that increase your risk of heart disease) to help protect your heart in the future. They'll offer you cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) to get you fit and strong again too. It's okay to feel low after surgery and the team can help you if you want to talk with them. Many people say their time in hospital becomes a blur. You may find it helpful to write down or have someone with you to help remember the information you get throughout your journey. It's important to look after your heart health long term so you don't develop more heart problems. You can do this by making lifestyle changes such as: - avoiding or drinking less alcohol (no more than the recommended limit of 14 units a week) - eating healthier foods - not smoking or using tobacco products - staying active."

Heart bypass surgery may not be an option if the arteries around your heart are too narrow or blocked. Instead, your doctor may want to do a coronary angioplasty and stent insertion operation. A coronary angioplasty is where a special kind of balloon is gently blown up inside the coronary artery to open it up. A stainless steel mesh called a stent is put in the artery to keep it open and let blood flow normally again. The balloon will be taken out. Before deciding to do an angioplasty, you'll have an angiogram (type of x-ray) that shows how blocked your arteries are. Your doctor will then know what the best treatment is for you. Before and after your surgery, you may need to take medications to support your heart. In some cases, coronary heart disease can be treated with different medications like: - antiplatelets - which help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke - beta blockers - which help reduce the risk of heart conditions like angina and heart attack - statins - which lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of angina, heart attack and stroke."

Over time, this type of exercise helps your heart and circulatory system to work better by helping to lower your blood pressure and resting heart rate, improving cholesterol levels and helping you maintain a healthy weight - balance and flexibility exercise - exercise like yoga, tai chi and Pilates where we hold our bodies in less stable positions. These exercises make sure our muscles don't get too tight and keep us flexible, helping avoid pain or injury and reduce the risk of having falls - resistance exercise - resistance training like lifting weights or using resistance bands and cables to strengthen your muscles. The stronger your muscles are, the harder they can work which takes the strain off your heart making it easier to do everyday tasks. Check in with your doctor before you start any resistance training as it may not be suitable for some people with heart conditions.

        ],
        "definition": " It's easy to skip if you're tired or in a rush but warming up and cooling down is important to staying safe and getting the most out of your workout. Warming up and cooling down helps by: - getting you in the right mood to exercise - preparing your body by raising your heart rate slowly, so there isn't a sudden increase in workload for your heart - sending blood to the active areas of your body - stretching to keep your muscles from shortening and increasing flexibility - warming up your muscles and preparing the joints for movement."

            "What should I eat and drink?"
        ],
        "definition": " Whatever your activity level, to stay fit and healthy everyone needs a good balance and variety of foods. This means choosing healthy carbohydrates, lean proteins, eating more fruit and vegetables and keeping hydrated. - carbohydrates - these are your body's main source of energy when you're exercising. It's best to choose high fibre, wholegrain varieties of oats, pasta, rice, breads and cereals. Carbohydrates provide the slow release of energy you need to fuel your exercise. There's no need to eat extra carbohydrates if you're active unless you're training for longer events - fruit and vegetables - these are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fibre which help keep your body and immune system healthy when you exercise. Aim for at least five portions a day - protein - known as the building blocks of life, these help your body grow and repair. You should try and include a portion of protein like lean meat, fish, eggs, dairy or alternatives sources like peas, pulses or beans with most meals - fluids - exercising raises your body temperature and your body tries to cool down by sweating. This causes a loss of water and salts through the skin. How much fluid you need depends on how long you exercise for, the temperature, and the amount you sweat. For most people, unless you are exercising for more than an hour, drinking 6-8 glasses of fluid (water, squash, fruit juice, caffeine-free teas) a day is a good idea.  Allow enough time to eat and drink before exercising to ensure your food is fully digested and avoid feeling sick or uncomfortable during exercise. Try to have a balanced meal 2-3 hours before exercising."

            "Do you have any Exercise tips?"
        ],
        "definition": " You may find it hard to be more active at first, but as time goes on it'll get easier as your body gets used to activity. You may only notice small improvements, but it all adds up. Here are our top tips to get you started: - breathe - remember to breathe deeply throughout an activity to keep oxygen coming into your body and to help keep your blood pressure under control - be sociable - go for a walk with a friend, join a group or get active for charity to meet like-minded people and have fun - keep an eye on your progress - many smart phones count the number of steps you walk each day or time how long it takes you to swim a lap of the pool. Challenging yourself and getting better at an activity is fun - make exercise part of your day - plan a time to do some physical activity that fits in with the rest of your day like by walking or cycling instead of driving. It could even be something as small as parking your car further from the shop or getting off the bus a stop early. If you miss a day, don't worry - just make sure you start again when you can - keep moving - everyday activities count, so look out for opportunities to be active during the day while you're inside or outdoors. Whilst moving, don't change position too quickly as this can cause dizziness - start small - try breaking down your exercise into short sessions throughout the day and build up from there. You could start by taking a five minute walk every day or trying our 10-minute workout - set realistic goals - setting goals like doing a short walk outside every day is fun and makes you feel great when you achieve them. If you want to keep setting new goals, read about using the FITT principle - set reminders where you can see them - stick post-it notes on the fridge or set daily reminders on your phone so you don't forget (it's easily done) - get variety - make a list of enjoyable activities you can do such as dancing or cycling and do a different activity each week. This way you're less likely to get bored and lose interest - be proud of yourself - pat yourself on the back when you hit a goal. You've looked after your heart and that's something to be proud of."
