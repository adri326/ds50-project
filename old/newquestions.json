If these proteins function abnormally, it can lead to a rise in the level of calcium inside your cells.\nThe extra calcium can cause arrhythmias - also known as abnormal heart rhythms. In particular CPVT causes a very fast heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia."

The more risk factors you have, the higher your risk. Risk factors include:\n- high blood pressure\n- high cholesterol\n- diabetes\n- smoking\n- being overweight\n- not doing enough physical activity.\nIdentifying and managing risk factors early on could help lower your risk of a heart attack in the future.  \nWe recommend that all women over the age of 40 visit their local GP or nurse for a health check to check their cardiovascular risk. If you're aged 40\u201374 and living in England, you can ask for an NHS health check. Similar schemes are also available in other parts of the UK.\nYour doctor should invite you to review your risk every five years, but you can also just make an appointment yourself to check your blood pressure and cholesterol. This check might help to highlight anything that could put you at increased risk of having a heart attack.\nIf you have a family history of heart or circulatory disease make sure you tell your doctor or nurse. You're considered to have a family history of heart or circulatory disease if:\n- your father or brother was under the age of 55 when they were diagnosed with a heart or circulatory disease or\n- your mother or sister was under the age of 65 when they were diagnosed with a heart or circulatory disease."

This is called valve stenosis or valve narrowing.\nIf the valve doesn\u2019t close fully, the blood will leak back into the heart instead of forwards into the body. This is called valve incompetence, valve regurgitation or a leaky valve.\nThese problems can put extra strain on your heart and make your heart work harder. This can cause you to have symptoms like feeling more tired and out of breath. And over time, it can increase your risk of having a heart attack, a stroke and other heart conditions."

Ions are charged atoms which allow electrical signals to flow in and out of cells through special channels and help your body function normally. There are different kinds of ions, including potassium and sodium, which are important for keeping the electrical system of your heart working properly.\nThe electrical system controls your heart by telling it when to squeeze and relax to pump blood. Between each heartbeat, the electrical system recharges. If you have LQTS, your heart takes longer than usual to recharge between beats.\nThis is because the channels are not letting the ions in or out of your cells well enough, which causes a delay. When seen on an ECG test (which records the electrical activity of your heart), this delay is called a prolonged QT interval."

You may be given a 24-hour ECG monitor to look at your heart for a longer period of time\n- exercise ECG \u2013 sometimes LQTS doesn\u2019t show up on a standard ECG, so the test needs to be done more than once and in different ways like when you\u2019re exercising.\nAs LQTS is sometimes inherited, you may also be referred for genetic testing to screen for any faulty genes that are linked with the condition. Your immediate family members (such as your parents, siblings and your children) may also be invited for an assessment."

These are fitted to help control the rhythm and rate of your heart or help correct life-threatening heart rhythms.\nSome people may need surgery to remove certain nerves that affect the heart to help reduce the chance of a sudden cardiac arrest. This is usually only for people who cannot take medication.\nOthers with LQTS may need to be prescribed potassium supplements from their doctor. They might also suggest you increase your uptake of potassium-rich foods like bananas, vegetables and pulses. If you\u2019re taking any new medication or supplements, always check with your pharmacist that what you\u2019re taking is okay with LQTS.\nIt's important to stay hydrated after illness.

This is a risk factor associated with heart attacks and stroke\n\nDuring and after the menopause, a woman\u2019s body gradually produces less oestrogen than it used to. This increases the risk of the coronary arteries narrowing whereas it previously protected the lining of the artery walls reducing the build-up of plaque.

This stops your breathing and starves your brain of oxygen.\n\nThe rhythm of your heart (which controls your heartbeat) is controlled by electrical impulses. If the electrical impulses go wrong, it can cause an abnormal heart rhythm known as an arrhythmia. Some arrhythmias can be dangerous if they\u2019re left untreated, they can cause a cardiac arrest. Your heart\u2019s rhythm and electrical impulses are no longer there after death, this means an abnormal heart rhythm can\u2019t be found and the heart\u2019s structure will appear normal. This is why the cause of the cardiac arrest can\u2019t be found and SADS might be diagnosed.\n\n**Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome affects around 500 people in the UK every year.**\n\nYou may also see sudden arrhythmic death syndrome, or SADS, being called sudden adult death syndrome.\n\nFind out more about Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome, what to expect from an inherited heart condition clinic and how you and your family can get support if you know someone who has sadly died suddenly.\n\nDownload Life with Inherited Abnormal Heart Rhythms"

        "definition": "SADS usually happens when an abnormal heart rhythm, known as an arrhythmia, goes untreated and leads to a cardiac arrest. An arrhythmia usually causes the heart to beat too fast, too slow or irregularly. It is usually caused by a heart condition that affects the heart\u2019s electrical system.\n\nSometimes, the heart condition that causes the arrhythmia can be inherited. Inherited heart conditions are often the cause of SADS if they are left undetected and untreated. These conditions include:\n\n- Long QT syndrome (LQTS)\n- Brugada syndrome\n- Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)\n- Progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD).\n\nA condition that causes SADS is undetectable after death because the heart will appear normal. But there are a few conditions that can cause SADS because of very subtle changes to the heart. SADS may still be diagnosed because the structural changes are too small to be seen when the heart is examined after death.\n\nThese conditions include:\n\n- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)\n- Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)\n- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)\n\nThanks to research, we now know that these conditions are caused by changes (or mutations) in one or more of our genes. We can sometimes discover these changes with genetic testing for family members, known as cascade testing. In some cases, this is the only way of telling if someone has an inherited heart condition or if they are at risk of developing one."

        "definition": "After an unexpected and sudden death, a coroner (someone who is responsible for investigating deaths) will usually ask for a post-mortem examination to be carried out to find out the cause of death. A post-mortem usually happens within two to three working days after the death.\n\nIf you have recently lost a loved one suddenly, or know someone who has, you may want to contact a bereavement officer at your local hospital. They can offer emotional and practical support during what might be an extremely difficult time for you, and they can be your main point of contact after the death and the post-mortem examination.\n\nDuring the post-mortem examination, a pathologist (a doctor trained in the study of disease) will look for conditions that could have caused the death, such as:\n\n- coronary heart disease\n- heart attack\n- heart failure\n- clots on the lungs\n\nIf the pathologist can\u2019t find an obvious cause of death, they may do further tests such as:\n\n- look at organ tissue\n- test for medications or drugs in the body\n- ask for an assessment by an expert heart pathologist.\n\nThe coroner will then decide on a cause of death. SADS is declared if the death is still unexplained after these tests.\n\nWhen this happens, the coroner will usually recommend that family members are tested for inherited heart conditions. Some people might not feel ready to be tested after losing a loved one which is understandable, but the tests are usually simple for most people. The earlier you and your family are tested, the less you risk a family member possibly leaving a heart problem untreated.\n\nIf someone in your family has been diagnosed with a heart condition or has passed away from SADS, you might be referred to a Genetics Clinic to assess your risk of developing the condition too."

        "definition": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an emergency condition when a tear appears in the wall of a coronary artery, which supplies blood to your heart. In some cases this can lead to a heart attack or cardiac arrest.\n\nYour coronary arteries are made up of three layers. SCAD happens when one or more of the inner layers of a coronary artery tears away from the outer layer.\n\nBlood is able to flow into the space between the layers and a blood clot forms, reducing the flow of blood through the artery.\n\nThis can lead to a heart attack, as the blood supply to your heart has been blocked. Or a cardiac arrest.\n\nSCAD is a rare heart condition that happens suddenly with no apparent warning. It is most common in women who are in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, but can happen to anyone. The condition can\u2019t currently be predicted or prevented.\n\nMost people who have SCAD do not have usual risk factors for heart disease such as high cholesterol, smoking or diabetes. These are often the risk factors which can increase your chance of having a heart attack. This means that SCAD is can be misdiagnosed or there may be a delay in diagnosis.\n\nPeople with no risk factors often ignore symptoms, as they don\u2019t think they\u2019d be at risk of a heart attack. But it\u2019s important to get checked out if you get any SCAD symptoms, so it can be diagnosed as early as possible."

        "definition": "Your heart, like any other muscle, needs physical activity to keep it healthy. Regular exercise improves overall health by helping manage many of the risk factors for heart and circulatory diseases, such as diabetes. Regular exercise also boosts energy and mood, as well as quality of sleep.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for your heart rate to increase while exercising. During exercise, you should aim to stay within your target heart rate (THR) to increase your fitness safely. Your THR is between 50% and 70% of your maximum heart rate.\n\nIf you have a heart condition, ask your GP or specialist about a safe heart rate when you're exercising. It may be helpful to do the \u2018talk test\u2019 while you are exercising. The talk test: if you can talk while being active, feel warm and are breathing a little more heavily than normal, you're moving at the right pace."

This causes the vein to come nearer to the surface of your skin, making it easier for your blood sample to be taken. The area will be cleaned with an antiseptic wipe or swab before the test is taken.\n\nThe needle is usually attached to either a syringe or a plastic device called a vacutainer and the blood put into a blood collecting container called a vial, so once the blood sample has been taken it can easily be sent to a laboratory for analysis. The vials often contain small amounts of chemical stopping the blood from clotting in transit.\n\nTaking a sample of blood usually only takes a few minutes."

If the levels are abnormal they can be linked to some heart conditions and symptoms linked to having a slow or fast heart rate or palpitations.\n- **Lipid profile** - measures your cholesterol level and breakdown of good and bad fats found in your blood.\n- **Liver tests** - the liver is a vital organ with many functions. This test gives a breakdown of how well the liver is functioning, which if not working well can have a major impact on the rest of the body.\n- **Clotting screen** - this measures how quickly your blood clots. This is important if you take blood thinning medication such as warfarin.\n- **BNP (B-type natriuretic peptides) tests** \u2013 these show the level of a hormone in your blood which if elevated can be a sign of heart failure.\n- **U and Es test** \u2013 this stands for urea (a protein found in the blood) and electrolytes which measures the levels of sodium, potassium and other important chemicals in your blood such as magnesium and calcium.

This records the heart's activity for a longer period of time, or whenever symptoms occur.\n\nAn ILR is implanted under the skin on your chest in a minor surgical procedure done under local anaesthetic. An ILR can continuously monitor your heartbeat for up to three years and help find out what may be causing your symptoms - such as dizzy spells or blackouts.\n\nThis is particularly useful for people who have symptoms that haven\u2019t been picked up through a standard ECG or Holter monitor."

Loop recorders are placed under the skin, usually on the left side of your chest.\n\nThere are two types of loop recorders, the traditional ones and the newer ones (you might hear the new ILRs called injectable loop recorders). The main difference is how they are implanted. The newer loop recorders are about 5cm long, the traditional loop recorders range between one to two inches long which is similar to a small pack of chewing gum."

        "definition": "Loop recorders continuously monitor your heart rate and the rhythm of your heart, like a longer version of the standard heart monitoring tests you may have already had. They pick up the electrical signals from your heart and recognise if your heart rate or rhythm are abnormal. The information is then recorded and stored in its memory for your medical team to review.\n\nWhen your device recognises something unusual, it will either begin recording your heart\u2019s activity automatically, or you might need to:\n\n- Manually start the recording using a small, hand-held activator machine when you feel symptoms\n- Use a mobile phone app to manually record the activity.\n\nIf your device needs you to use an activator, hold it over the area of your chest where you ILR is, and it will begin recording. Your healthcare team will tell you if you can use the mobile phone app for your device and how to use it, or show you how to use your activator before you go home. They will also answer any questions you have.\n\nThe recording will either be sent to your medical team automatically using a small bedside monitoring machine you might be given, or you might be asked to go to the hospital clinic where the results can be downloaded. Both options are quick and won\u2019t need a procedure, and you will be told which one you need to do."

The device can move slightly because it isn\u2019t secured in a set position. It is okay for your device to move slightly as long as it doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable, and it can still record your heart\u2019s activity. Most people who notice that their device has moved slightly won\u2019t feel any discomfort. If your device feels uncomfortable or you are worried about the movement, contact your healthcare team.\n\nFor some people the risks can be worrying, if you are concerned you can talk to your doctor about it before your loop recorder is fitted.

If you are unable to exercise you may be given a medicine instead which increases your heart rate. The camera takes pictures of your heart while you are exercising and your heart rate and blood pressure will be closely monitored throughout.\n\nYou will then have a break of about an hour, in which you will be asked to drink plenty to clear the radiation from your system. You will then go back for the rest part of the scan, which involves the same injection and camera, although this time you will just lie on the bed while the images are taken."

After a transplant you\u2019re at a higher risk of developing skin cancer\ndon\u2019t smoke \u2013 this is a fresh start to keep your heart healthy\ndo regular exercise - such as walking around your home and building up to short walks outside\neat a healthy, balanced diet \u2013 start by getting 1-2 portions of fruit and veg with every meal and avoid too much sugar, saturated fats and salt\naim to control your cholesterol and blood pressure levels - swap saturated fats (butter, processed meats, biscuits) for unsaturated fats (olive oil, oily fish, nuts), maintaining a healthy weight, and reduce salt in your diet.\nAnother important way to recover is to be aware of personal and food hygiene to avoid getting an infection. You can do this by:\n\navoiding anyone who has an infection, including cold, flu and Covid\nnot eating high-risk foods that could cause food poisoning such as raw eggs, mayonnaise, raw meats, unpasteurised milk and cheeses, and shellfish\nkeeping your pets healthy, wormed, and vaccinated so you don\u2019t pick up any parasites or germs that can cause illness. You should also avoid changing cat litter trays (the infection toxoplasmosis is carried by cats)\nwashing your hands after gardening or if you have been handling any pets to avoid picking up parasites and germs.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to get onto a cardiac rehab programme. Cardiac rehab can help you to recover as quickly as possible and talk about your experience with others who've been through similar.

If you have one of these issues, it can affect how your blood flows through your heart in two ways:\n\nif your valve doesn't open fully or becomes stiff, it will block the flow of blood. This is called valve stenosis or narrowing\nif the valve doesn't close properly, it will allow blood to leak backwards. This is called valve incompetence, regurgitation, or a leaky valve.\nBoth stenosis and regurgitation can put extra strain on your heart because your heart must pump harder to push the blood through the valves. Symptoms of these issues include:\n\nchest pain\ndizziness and fainting\npalpitations (a pounding or fluttering in the chest)\nshortness of breath\nswelling of your ankles and legs\ntiredness.\nYou can discuss all of your treatment options with your doctor so you make the best decision.

If it\u2019s possible to repair the valve, your surgeon may do this rather than replace it\nvalve replacement is when the old valve is replaced with a new valve. The most common types of replacement valves are mechanical (artificial) valves or tissue (animal) valves.\nIn some cases, a Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure may be used if you're an adult and not well enough to have traditional heart surgery. This is a less invasive way of performing valve surgery and is a newer treatment option. Speak with your surgeon about the advantages and disadvantages of this type of surgery as it's not suitable for everyone.\n\nWhether or not you have heart valve surgery, and whether the operation is a repair or a replacement will depend on many things.

This allows the camera to easily see the heart's structure and blood flow. This causes a warm, flushing sensation throughout the body lasting a few seconds which some people may find strange, but isn\u2019t painful.\n\nYou will then be asked to lie on a bed which passes through the CT scanner. The length of the test depends on the type of scanner used and why you are having the scan."

The aortic valve opens to let blood flow from your heart to your aorta. The aorta is the big vessel supplying your body with oxygen-rich blood.\n\nIf you have severe aortic stenosis, you may need to replace your aortic valve.\n\nTAVI was originally used as an alternative to heart valve surgery for people who weren\u2019t well enough to have open heart surgery to replace their aortic valves. But TAVI is now being used for people at lower risk of complications from heart surgery because research is showing it\u2019s at least as effective as heart valve surgery after one year. TAVI is also showing signs of working over a longer period, but more research is needed before it becomes the first choice for patients with severe aortic stenosis.\n\nWe encourage you to discuss with your doctor whether TAVI or heart valve surgery is right for you. They should talk through your options and listen carefully to your views and concerns before you agree to having the procedure. Your family can be involved too, if you wish. It can feel hard to ask questions about difficult topics such as risks and life expectancy, but most people feel better once they do.\n\nTo help decide whether TAVI is right for you, you may have one or more of the following tests:\n\nBlood tests\nEchocardiogram\nECG\nCT scans\nCoronary angiogram\nTrans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE)\nChest X-ray\nBreathing tests\nMany people feel scared to have tests or worry they will hurt but the tests are normally quick and painless.

Usually, you\u2019ll be advised not to lift, pull, or push anything heavy (like a vacuum) for:\n\none week, if you had your TAVI procedure through your upper leg\nsix weeks, if you had your TAVI procedure through your chest\nWhen you leave hospital, you\u2019ll be given medication to help you avoid blood clots. You\u2019ll be told how long you need to take it for. Any changes to any other medication you are on will also be discussed. If you have any concerns about your medication after you leave hospital, speak to your GP or pharmacist.\n\nOnce you leave hospital, you will probably have a TAVI nurse that can offer support and/or be invited to cardiac rehab.\n\nIt takes people different periods of time to recover after a TAVI procedure. Most people take about six to ten weeks to feel fully recovered.\n\nA few weeks after the procedure, you will probably have a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist at the TAVI centre. After this your local cardiologist or GP normally takes over your care.\n\nRecovering from a TAVI can be emotionally difficult as well as physically. People often tell us they've felt low, frustrated and detached from others after big health events like this. It's very normal and the feelings usually improve as you recover.\n\nTalk to your family, friends and GP about how you're feeling as this will help.\n\nFind out about other ways to get emotional support"

        "definition": "If you have a condition called aortic stenosis, your aortic valve doesn\u2019t open fully.\n\nYour heart valves play an important role in keeping blood flowing through your heart. The aortic valve opens to let blood flow from your heart to your aorta. The aorta is the big vessel supplying your body with oxygen-rich blood.\n\nIf you have severe aortic stenosis, you may need to replace your aortic valve.\n\nTAVI was originally used as an alternative to heart valve surgery for people who weren\u2019t well enough to have open heart surgery to replace their aortic valves. But TAVI is now being used for people at lower risk of complications from heart surgery because research is showing it\u2019s at least as effective as heart valve surgery after one year. TAVI is also showing signs of working over a longer period, but more research is needed before it becomes the first choice for patients with severe aortic stenosis.\n\nWe encourage you to discuss with your doctor whether TAVI or heart valve surgery is right for you. They should talk through your options and listen carefully to your views and concerns before you agree to having the procedure. Your family can be involved too, if you wish. It can feel hard to ask questions about difficult topics such as risks and life expectancy, but most people feel better once they do.\n\nTo help decide whether TAVI is right for you, you may have one or more of the following tests:\n\nBlood tests\nEchocardiogram\nECG\nCT scans\nCoronary angiogram\nTrans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE)\nChest X-ray\nBreathing tests\nMany people feel scared to have tests or worry they will hurt but the tests are normally quick and painless.
