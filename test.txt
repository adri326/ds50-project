### Question:
What happens after an angiogram?

### Answer:
After the procedure, the catheter will be removed and a collagen plug called an angioseal will be left in place. This is common if the procedure is performed through the groin. You will need to stay on bedrest for about an hour. Some doctors prefer to apply a pressure pad to the wound, in which case you will need to stay on bedrest a bit longer, usually around 4 hours.  
If your procedure is performed through your wrist, a pressure device to reduce the risk of bleeding is left in place and the nurses will gradually reduce the pressure over a short period of time then remove it altogether. You will be able to sit in a chair almost straight away.
The nurses will check your blood pressure and pulse and keep an eye on your wound. It is important to drink plenty of fluid as this helps to flush the dye out of your system.
As long as you feel well, you should be able to go home the same day, although this may depend on the results. Your doctor will explain these to you before you leave.
The most common after-effect is bruising at the site where the catheter was inserted which may feel tender and numb for a few days. You might feel tired, but you should be back to normal within a few days. If you are worried about any of the after-effects, contact your doctor.
Some people who have a coronary angiogram go on to have a treatment called coronary angioplasty.

### Question:
What is coronary heart disease (CHD)?

### Answer:
Over time, a fatty material called atheroma can build up inside your coronary arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. Eventually, your arteries may become so narrow that they can't get enough oxygen rich blood to your heart.  
If a piece of atheroma breaks off, it can cause a blood clot form. This clot can block your coronary artery and cut off the supply of blood and oxygen to your heart muscle. This is known as a heart attack.

### Question:
Heart stent recovery: what happens after angioplasty?

### Answer:
Most people can go home the same day or the next day, but if you’ve had an emergency angioplasty after a heart attack it’s likely you’ll need to stay in hospital for longer.
When you get home, check the area where the catheter tube was put in. Expect to have some bruising and tenderness, but you should contact your doctor if:
- you get any pain, redness or swelling
- or if the bruising worsens
- or if you develop a temperature

Before you leave hospital, someone will have a chat with you about your recovery and what you can and can’t do. It’s normal to feel tired afterwards but most people find that they’re back to normal after a few days. However, if you’ve also had a heart attack, it will take longer to recover.
If you’ve had a stent fitted, you’ll be given medicines to help reduce the risk of blood clots forming in and around the stent. They may include:
- aspirin
- anti-platelet medication such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel
You may also be asked to take cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins.
If you’ve had an emergency angioplasty, you may be invited to go on a cardiac rehab programme, a course of exercise and information sessions that help you to recover as quickly as possible.
It can feel worrying to have a stent fitted, especially if you’ve had an emergency angioplasty. But many people find recovering from angioplasty is a positive moment to make healthy lifestyle changes that will improve your health and everyday life.

### Question:
What is Stable angina?

### Answer:
This is the most common type of angina. It tends to happen when your heart works harder, such as when you’re walking uphill, and goes away when you rest. 
You’ll usually know when it’s likely to happen and the pain or discomfort is similar to what you’ve had before. 
Stable angina lasts five minutes or less, and improves if you rest or take your medication.

### Question:
How is the recovering from a heart attack in the hospital?

### Answer:
You'll usually stay in hospital for about two to five days after having a heart attack. This depends on what treatment you've had and how well you're recovering.
If you’ve had coronary angioplasty or stents, it’s likely you'll stay in hospital for two or three days.
If you’ve had coronary bypass surgery, it’s likely you'll stay in hospital for at least a week.
During your stay, you’ll be monitored and have tests to see how well your heart is recovering.
When you first arrive in hospital, you’ll likely be admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU) which is for people with serious heart issues who need to be closely watched. During your stay, you might be moved to a cardiac ward.
You won’t be discharged (sent home) from hospital until your doctor is certain you’re well enough to go home. To decide this, they’ll talk to you about going home and do assessments such as have you climb stairs to see if you’re fit enough.

### Question:
What is a healthy or normal blood pressure?

### Answer:
There are two categories of normal blood pressure:
- Normal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg. For over-80s, because it’s normal for arteries to get stiffer as we get older, the ideal blood pressure is under 150/90 mmHg (or 145/85 mmHg at home).
- High-normal blood pressure, sometimes called ‘pre-hypertension’, is when you don’t have an ideal blood pressure but you also don’t have high blood pressure. It’s usually considered to be between 120/80 mmHg and 140/90 mmHg. Being at this level might prompt you to live a healthier lifestyle so you don’t develop high blood pressure.

### Question:
What are the symptoms of vascular dementia?

### Answer:
The symptoms of vascular dementia can develop suddenly or gradually.
Your early symptoms will depend on which part of your brain has been affected. This means different people can experience different symptoms.
Vascular dementia can affect people of all ages, although it's often associated with growing older. If you're under 65 years old, it's known as 'young onset' or 'early onset' vascular dementia.
Early signs of vascular dementia include:
- concentration problems, such as struggling to focus during a conversation
- mood and personality changes, such as irritability or feeling low
- poor short-term memory
- difficulty with everyday skills, such as reading or driving
- difficulty with decision making and planning
- slowing down of thought processes
- difficulty saying your thoughts clearly.

In the later stages, you may experience symptoms such as:
- becoming increasingly confused and disorientated
- long-term memory loss and difficulty concentrating
- increasing difficulty remembering words and communicating
- difficulty with balance or falling frequently
- depression and personality changes
- in some cases, loss of bladder control.
### End Answer

### Question:
How is vascular dementia diagnosed?

### Answer:
If you suspect you or a loved one might have vascular dementia, it’s important to talk to your GP as soon as possible. The GP will:
- explore what your issues are, when they started and how often they have been happening
- ask how these issues have been affecting your life and those around you
- carry out physical examinations, mental ability tests and other routine tests to help them rule out other physical or mental health causes.

Consider taking a loved one to you to the appointment, not only for support, but also to help the GP get a complete picture of how things have been for you.
If you can’t take a loved one, your GP may want to reach out to them on the phone so they can better understand your daily routine and skills. This will only happen with your permission.
If your GP suspects vascular dementia, they will refer you to a specialist or memory clinic. You may then have a CT or MRI scan of your brain to check for any abnormalities.
Unfortunately, getting an accurate diagnosis can sometimes take time. But it’s important you receive this so you can get the correct treatment and support.

### Question:
 What is angioplasty?

### Answer:
Angioplasty is a common, generally painless procedure that is used to open up narrowed or blocked arteries (the vessels that supply blood to your heart muscle). You’ll be given local anaesthetic at the start of the procedure. A narrow flexible tube (called a catheter) is put into your wrist or groin (the area of your hip between your stomach and thigh) and pushed up to the coronary artery. A small balloon at the end of the tube is blown up to widen the narrowed part of your artery.
Sometimes if the artery is so narrow that the balloon can’t pass through it, a tiny drill might also be used (this is called rotablation) to chip away at the fatty deposits, to gradually widen the narrowing.
Most of the time angioplasty is combined with putting in a small metal mesh tube (called a stent). When the balloon is deflated and the catheter tube and balloon are removed, the stent stays in place, acting like a scaffold to keep your artery open.
You may hear your doctor call coronary angioplasty with stenting a PCI. PCI is a medical abbreviation (name) for percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Question:
What is Unstable angina?

### Answer:
Unstable angina can feel different to your normal angina symptoms. It can happen even when you’re resting. Unstable angina feels more severe and lasts longer. Your symptoms might not improve when you rest or take medication. 
If your symptoms don’t improve when you rest of take medication, you should call 999 immediately.

### Question:
What are the symptoms of atherosclerosis?

### Answer:
Most people with atherosclerosis don’t know they have it because most of the symptoms don’t show up until one of your arteries is narrowed or blocked. The most common symptoms of atherosclerosis include:
- chest pain 
- confusion, as a result of blood not flowing to your brain 
- difficulty breathing 
- feeling very tired 
- pain in any of your limbs, where there may be a blocked artery 
- weak muscles 
If you have any of these symptoms or think you may have atherosclerosis, please contact your GP.

### Question:
What are the risks of having an angiogram?

### Answer:
An angiogram is a relatively safe, very common test. Serious complications are rare and your doctor will discuss these before you have it done.
Following an angiogram, some people may develop a collection of blood under the skin, which is called a haematoma. This can be uncomfortable and cause bruising, but it should go down after a few days. However, contact your doctor if you have any concerns.
A small amount of radiation is used during an angiogram. The doctor will bear this in mind if you have been exposed to higher levels than normal.

### End Answer

### Question:
How does obesity increase the risk of heart and circulatory diseases?

### Answer:
Excess weight can lead to fatty material building up in your arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood to your organs). If the arteries that carry blood to your heart get damaged and clogged, it can lead to a heart attack. If this happens in the arteries that carry blood to your brain it can lead to a stroke or vascular dementia.

### Question:
What should I do when a family member is diagnosed with an inherited heart condition ?

### Answer:
If you’re a relative of someone who has been diagnosed with an inherited heart condition (IHC), it’s recommended that you’re referred to a specialist centre.  Here you’ll be tested to see if you have the same faulty gene as your family member, which could lead to an IHC. This type of genetic testing through families is called cascade testing.

### Question:
What are the benefits of heart bypass surgery?

### Answer:
The benefits and risks of heart bypass surgery are different for everyone and depend on the seriousness of your heart disease, type of operation you need, your age, and your overall health. The benefits of surgery include:
- better sleep – thanks to improved symptoms of conditions like less pain from angina and peripheral arterial disease
- better mood and mental health – due to reduced risk of angina, heart attack, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and other conditions caused by coronary heart disease
- more energy – everyday tasks and physical activities become easier and more enjoyable.

### Question:
How is vascular dementia treated?

### Answer:
Although we’re funding research to find new treatments, there's currently no cure for vascular dementia. However, there’s lots of help and support to help you to continue to live well.

With Medication:
You might be given medication to control high blood pressure or high cholesterol. This may have contributed to your condition and controlling it can help slow down the progression.
If you have vascular dementia, medication given for Alzheimer’s disease isn’t recommended. However, you could be given this medication if you have a mixed diagnosis of vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

With Lifestyle changes:
Research has shown that improving your lifestyle can help slow down the progression of vascular dementia. There are some small changes you can make that might reduce the chance of more damage to the blood vessels in your brain:
- eat healthily
- be physically active
- keep to a healthy weight and lose weight if necessary
- don't smoke
- cut down on alcohol
- control high blood pressure
- control cholesterol levels
- control blood sugar levels (if you have diabetes).

With Support programmes:
Your healthcare team may also suggest a range of social activities to improve your wellbeing and slow down the progression as much as possible. Some examples could be:
- group cognitive (this means the process of thinking, reasoning, or remembering) stimulation therapy – taking part in group activities and discussions to help with memory and connecting with others
- group reminiscence therapy - sharing life experiences, memories and stories from the past to help improve your wellbeing
- cognitive rehabilitation or occupational therapy – getting support in carrying out everyday tasks independently for as long as possible.

### Question:
How is congenital heart disease detected?

### Answer:
Some congenital heart problems are now picked up when the mother has an ultrasound scan during pregnancy (usually at the 20-week scan), but sometimes they are not found until after the baby has been born. Some conditions may not be discovered until the child is older or even an adult.
In babies and toddlers, congenital heart disease can have a range of symptoms because every child and condition is different. More common symptoms include extreme tiredness, poor feeding, excessive sweating, rapid heartbeat, breathing problems, chest pain and a blue tinge to the skin. If you notice any of these symptoms in your child, you should seek medical attention.

If a congenital heart condition is suspected after your 20-week pregnancy scan:
- You may be asked to attend another scan with a specialist or referred to a fetal medicine unit, obstetrician or a specialist in cardiac or child medicine.
- If a congenital heart condition is confirmed, you should be given a detailed description of the problem, information about any surgery that might be needed, and the overall long-term outlook.
- If appropriate, specialist monitoring and care will be provided before, during and after the birth so that your baby can receive tests and treatment as soon as possible.  Some heart conditions can now also be treated in-utero (in the womb) before the birth.

If a congenital heart condition is suspected in a baby or child:
Your child may undergo a physical examination and heart tests such as an ECG.
If the diagnosis is confirmed, they will be seen by a paediatric cardiologist, who will manage their care. You should be given a detailed description of the problem, information about any surgery that might be needed, and the overall long-term outlook for your child.

### Question:
Do you have any Exercise tips?

### Answer:
You may find it hard to be more active at first, but as time goes on it’ll get easier as your body gets used to activity. You may only notice small improvements, but it all adds up. Here are our top tips to get you started:
- breathe – remember to breathe deeply throughout an activity to keep oxygen coming into your body and to help keep your blood pressure under control
- be sociable - go for a walk with a friend, join a group or get active for charity to meet like-minded people and have fun
- keep an eye on your progress - many smart phones count the number of steps you walk each day or time how long it takes you to swim a lap of the pool. Challenging yourself and getting better at an activity is fun
- make exercise part of your day - plan a time to do some physical activity that fits in with the rest of your day like by walking or cycling instead of driving. It could even be something as small as parking your car further from the shop or getting off the bus a stop early. If you miss a day, don't worry - just make sure you start again when you can
- keep moving - everyday activities count, so look out for opportunities to be active during the day while you're inside or outdoors. Whilst moving, don’t change position too quickly as this can cause dizziness
- start small - try breaking down your exercise into short sessions throughout the day and build up from there. You could start by taking a five minute walk every day or trying our 10-minute workout
- set realistic goals – setting goals like doing a short walk outside every day is fun and makes you feel great when you achieve them. If you want to keep setting new goals, read about using the FITT principle
- set reminders where you can see them – stick post-it notes on the fridge or set daily reminders on your phone so you don’t forget (it’s easily done)
- get variety - make a list of enjoyable activities you can do such as dancing or cycling and do a different activity each week. This way you’re less likely to get bored and lose interest
- be proud of yourself - pat yourself on the back when you hit a goal. You’ve looked after your heart and that’s something to be proud of.

### Question:
What happens during heart bypass surgery?

### Answer:
Before the operation, you’ll be given medicine (general anaesthetic) that puts you to sleep. The medicine is injected or inhaled as a gas through a mask. A specialist doctor (called an anaesthetist) gives you the medicine before the surgery starts and stays with you to make sure you have enough to keep you asleep.
You’ll then go into the operating room for the surgery which normally lasts three to six hours. Surgeons usually make a cut down the middle of the breastbone (the long flat bone in the middle of the chest) to reach your heart. If you have a vein graft from your leg or an artery graft from your arm, they will make smaller cuts in these places too.
A heart-lung bypass machine will move the blood around your body while the surgeon operates on your heart. Some surgeons may carry out coronary bypass operations without this machine. This is called beating heart surgery.
Your surgeon may do newer bypass surgeries like endoscopic or minimally invasive surgery. These involve making several small cuts and using an endoscope camera to see the blood vessels and heart. Surgeons do this because it can help you get up out of bed sooner and speed up recovery.
If your surgeon needs to cut your breastbone, you’ll have a wound down the middle of your chest. It’s normal to be worried or scared about having scars after surgery but you're not alone. Listen to people who have had heart surgery and how they learned to accept their scars.
Your surgeon will be around to answer any questions you may have before and after surgery. This includes talking about the different types of surgeries available to you.
